/**
 * ENG-260 away drill: an automation fires with NO live user session and its
 * action executes as the granting user against Maple's own (now Auth.js
 * protected) API.
 *
 * The test boots the REAL Maple app, then composes real store + guard +
 * actions + automations the way the umbrella does — with `actAs` set to the
 * shipped Auth.js preset over the same AUTH_SECRET the app booted with. The
 * grant is captured "while present" (enable + approve); the emit carries no
 * request headers, so the ONLY way the call can reach the 401-walled API is
 * the actAs-minted real session token.
 *
 * The drill's executing step is `host_getProfile` — an auth-walled call an
 * automation may legally run unattended — because THE LAW (design §12) means a
 * destructive-or-external tool never enters an unattended run at all:
 * automations "may **not** move money, message humans, or delete — those tools
 * are not projected into an automation run at all". This file drove
 * `host_transferMoney` until 2026-07-31; that expectation predates the law, and
 * moving money is the first thing §12 names. The law's own behaviour on that
 * tool is now its own scenario here, so the authority mechanic and the law are
 * each proven instead of colliding.
 *
 * Why a read and not a write: Maple's ENTIRE mutating surface is off-limits or
 * unreachable. `/api/transfers` and `/api/orders` both move money, `/api/demo/reset`
 * is destructive, `/api/voice` sits on a PUBLIC proxy prefix (src/proxy.ts) so a
 * write there would sail past the auth wall and prove nothing, and `/api/demo/pin`
 * writes the app row in the SERVER's store, which this test's own temp store
 * cannot see. So the drill proves the authority mechanic on the strongest legal
 * call Maple has: `/api/profile` is the one endpoint whose answer is derived from
 * the SESSION rather than the shared demo seed, which is what lets the away run's
 * own recorded answer name the granting user.
 *
 * That answer is captured at the stack's own `fetch` seam. It was read out of the
 * guard's effect ledger until 2026-07-31, which worked only because
 * `host_getProfile` mis-voted `write` and so got receipted; now that the vote
 * reads `verb_noun` correctly the call is a `read`, and §12's "reads are silent,
 * always" means there is no receipt to read. The real HTTP response is the better
 * witness anyway — it is what Maple actually sent, not a record of it — and the
 * empty ledger became an assertion of its own.
