# Vendo

Vendo is a devtool that lets a company's users customize its product: an
embedded agent that acts through the host's own API as the user and renders
generated UI in a sandboxed, brand-native surface.

## Layout

- `packages/` — the ten `@vendoai/*` blocks + the `@vendoai/vendo` umbrella and
  `vendoai` alias. The behavior contract is the exported types/zod schemas and
  the test suites — there are no prose contract docs; layering enforced by
  `scripts/dependency-guard.mjs` in `pnpm lint`
- `examples/` — the demo host `demo-bank` (Maple) and the framework integration
  examples (`ai-sdk-agent`, `mastra-agent`, `claude-code-plugin`)
- `corpus/` — init-extraction corpus harness (`pnpm corpus`)
- `docs-site/` — the public docs site

## Commands

- `pnpm install` · `pnpm build` · `pnpm test` · `pnpm test:affected` (scoped to changed packages — the local default) · `pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm lint` (turbo-cached)
- Demo: `pnpm --filter demo-bank dev` (Maple)

## Vendo Cloud

- Cloud sells exactly two categories: infrastructure that is painful to run
  yourself (sandbox, inference, persistence, brokers, hosted automations) and
  inherently multi-party coordination (sharing, registry, orgs, SSO, billing,
  console). Everything else stays OSS.
- Hard BYO rule: every single-player capability keeps a no-key
  bring-your-own path (own Postgres, sandbox account, model key, OAuth apps).
- Adapter rule: one adapter interface per block; Cloud is just another
  implementation shipped in OSS. `VENDO_API_KEY` sets Cloud defaults only for
  adapter slots the host left unset; an explicitly passed adapter always
  wins; no hidden key-conditional branches. Reference implementation:
  `selectConnections` in `packages/vendo/src/compose-selection.ts`.
- Gating is valid key + meter, nothing else: no capability booleans, no
  entitlement protocol, no validate endpoint, no client-side checks. Key
  problems surface on the first real service call.
- Managed inference rides the console's Anthropic-compatible model gateway
  through the stock `@ai-sdk/anthropic` provider, so inference traffic does
  not carry the deployment-identity headers and does not feed the deployment
  inventory (known, accepted).

## Rules

- Answer code-behavior questions from source only — read the definition and
  its callers, cite `file:line`. Docs and comments are leads, never answers.
- Use Yousef's Vendo Cloud account for any and all testing.
- Vendo-facing API/SDK/CLI design additionally routes through the
  **vendo-dx** skill (on top of api-design-dx).
- Never commit to `main`; branch and open a PR.
- UI-affecting changes are verified in a real browser. Tests and typecheck
  alone don't count.
- Local gate = `pnpm build && pnpm test:affected && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint`
  on the touched scope. The FULL suite runs only in CI — the PR's green `ci`
  check is the gate of record; never run the full suite locally.
- `vendo-web` is archived. The Cloud half now lives in the private monorepo
  and consumes these packages as `workspace:*`, so it moves in lockstep with
  every release automatically — no downstream bump step.

## Tests

- A harness that mocks the counterparty proves nothing. When a feature spans
  a producer and a consumer, test the SEAM: write through the real write path
  and read back through the real read path, with no stub on either side. The
  host-component previews shipped four times with a green suite and a dead
  feature because the producer and the consumer each mocked the other, so
  they could never disagree. Anything this repo emits for the console to read
  (`.vendo/components/`, `vendo_*` collections, blob namespaces) is one of
  those seams, and the console's copy of the schema is a mirror — see the
  testing section of the console's own `AGENTS.md` for the full lesson.
- Two suites must not share a directory that either of them deletes.
  `next build` wipes its whole `distDir`, so a fixture dev server's dist dir
  is a SIBLING of the build's, never a child. Nesting them took out all 36
  `automations-e2e` tests on every full-suite run while each suite passed
  alone, and which suite lost varied by scheduling — which read as flake.
- A poll inside a test must not have a wall-clock budget tighter than the
  test's own timeout. The test timeout is the hang-detector; a tighter inner
  budget is a second, invisible speed limit that reports a product bug when
  the machine is merely busy.
- The full suite is CI's job now (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), fanned out over
  a shared turbo remote cache: `typecheck-lint` (build + typecheck + lint),
  `test-shards` (9 intra-package vitest shards for the big three — vendo×4,
  store×3, ui×2), `test-rest` (the other packages in 2 turbo groups: guard +
  actions, then everything else expressed as negations so a new package joins
  the day it is created), and `coverage-merge`, which replays the shards' blob
  reports and enforces the per-package coverage floors — a floor is only
  meaningful against the whole suite, so the per-shard runs pass
  `--coverage.thresholds.lines=0` and the gate moves to the merge. The
  aggregate job is named `ci`; the required checks on main are `ci`,
  `integration`, `conformance`, and `audit`, and renaming any of those job
  names breaks merges. No browser runs in CI (2026-08-06) — headless
  mis-resolves `:focus-visible` and `light-dark()`, so the Playwright suites
  stay a LOCAL pre-PR gate.
- Iterating on a browser spec is two-speed. While you are editing, start ONE
  warm hot-reloading harness (`VENDO_HARNESS_DEV=1` plus a pinned
  `VENDO_HARNESS_PORT`) and rerun specs against it with the same two variables —
  reuse is dev-mode-only, so every rerun skips the build and starts in seconds.
  Then one run WITHOUT the flag — a fresh production build — is the proof of
  record, and the only result worth reporting. A production run never reuses a
  server: `vite preview` serves whatever was built last, so a reused one greens
  the previous build.
- An agent proves a browser flow by SCRIPTING it, never by stepping through it
  click-by-click: write one throwaway Playwright script for the whole flow, run
  it once, judge the screenshot/video artifacts — one model turn instead of
  fifteen, seconds instead of minutes. Interactive stepping is for two cases
  only: exploring UI the agent didn't write, and diagnosing a scripted run that
  failed for unclear reasons — and whatever stepping teaches gets banked as a
  script so the flow is never stepped twice.
- `--continue` and a turbo concurrency bound are the standing rule wherever the
  suite runs: `--continue` so one red package never hides every other package's
  result; the bound (2 in CI's `test-rest`, 4 in the root `test` /
  `test:affected` / `test:coverage` scripts) because unbounded parallelism runs
  ~27 vitest workers at once on a 12-core laptop (load average ~150) and the
  full-stack suites in `packages/vendo` then miss their 30s budget on work that
  takes 5s alone. A timeout is a hang-detector; do not raise one to buy headroom
  the machine never had. Locally, run `pnpm test:affected` — same caps, scoped to
  changed packages; never run the full suite on a laptop.
- Turbo's bound is only the OUTER layer. Each package's vitest sizes its own
  worker pool to the CPU count, so 4 packages at a time meant ~60 processes and
  ~13GB on a 12-core laptop, and an OOM kill on a 15GB runner — the PGlite
  suites (`store`, `guard`, the fixtures) boot an embedded Postgres per worker.
  `VITEST_MIN_FORKS/MAX_FORKS` and `VITEST_MIN_THREADS/MAX_THREADS` cap the
  inner layer at 2 workers — set in the root `test` / `test:affected` /
  `test:coverage` scripts locally, and at job level on `test-shards` and
  `test-rest` in CI (which invoke vitest and turbo directly, so they do not
  inherit the root scripts). Set them in any new script or workflow that runs
  the suite. The MIN half is not optional:
  vitest 2.1 defaults `minThreads` to the CPU count independently of the max, so
  a max-only cap makes Tinypool throw `minThreads and maxThreads must not
  conflict` before a single test runs. `fileParallelism: false` still wins where
  a package sets it, so the serial suites stay serial.
