# Contributing to Vendo

Thanks for helping make Vendo better.

## Development setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Node 22+, pnpm 11. The repo is a turbo monorepo: `packages/` are the published
`@vendoai/*` libraries. The behavior contract is each package's exported
types/zod schemas and its test suites (layering is enforced in `pnpm lint`).
The demo host apps live under `examples/`.

## Making changes

- Branch from `main`; open a PR against `main`.
- `pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` must pass.
- `pnpm lint` blocks on four things: the dependency guard, the portability
  gate, `eslint.blocking.config.mjs` over `packages/*`, and each `examples/*`
  app's own eslint. A rule joins the blocking config only when `packages/*`
  reports zero findings for it, so main stays green and every finding it prints
  is a new one; the rules still waiting on a clean tree are listed at the top
  of that file.
- `pnpm lint:report` is report-only and always exits 0. It runs the rest of
  eslint-plugin-sonarjs, plus knip, over `packages/*`. Nothing it prints blocks
  a merge; it exists so a rule can be judged from real counts before it goes
  blocking. Run it after `pnpm build` — knip loads each package's vite/vitest
  config, and those import built `dist/`.
- UI-affecting changes need before/after screenshots in the PR.
- Keep PRs focused; small is reviewable.

## What happens to your PR

Vendo is developed in a private monorepo that also holds the closed-source
Cloud half, and the open-source half is projected out to this repo. Your change
travels in two steps, and only the first one involves you.

- **It is reviewed and merged here.** Your PR goes through this repo's merge
  queue and shows as merged, because it is — there is no internal PR standing in
  for it, and nothing closes your PR in place of merging it.
- **It is then imported inward**, into the private repo, by a maintainer. This
  needs nothing from you and leaves no trace on your PR.

That second step is deliberately not automatic. An import writes to the private
repo from a public source, so the maintainer who reviewed the change is the
right person to decide when it crosses — not a timer.

Maintainers: run the `upstream-import` workflow on `runvendo/vendo-cloud` via
`workflow_dispatch`, passing this PR's number as the `pr` input. It lands on
`oss/upstream-pr` and opens a PR there; nothing merges itself into the private
repo.

## Releases

Releases are tag-driven and CI-only: pushing a `v*` tag runs
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which publishes the lockstep `@vendoai/*`
group to npm via OIDC trusted publishing — no npm tokens exist, in CI or
anywhere else. Feature PRs include a changeset (`pnpm changeset`); the
Version Packages PR accumulates the bumps between releases. Maintainers'
full release runbook lives in the private repo.
