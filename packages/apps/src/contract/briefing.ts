/**
 * THE briefing pack — everything a writer is told about the PRODUCT, assembled
 * once and handed to both generation rungs byte for byte.
 *
 * The two rungs are the screen agent (a document out of this host's components)
 * and the box (real code on a machine). They used to be told different things:
 * the screen agent got the theme, the design rules and the tool shape card and
 * never saw `.vendo/brief.md`; the box got neither theme, nor rules, nor
 * catalog, nor brief. Product knowledge that only one writer has is a silent
 * gap — the person cannot tell which rung answered, so both must know the same
 * things.
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS are the other half and stay per-rung on purpose: the screen
 * agent's dialect manual and the box's scaffold task brief are different jobs.
 * This file renders knowledge, never instructions.
