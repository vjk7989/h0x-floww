/**
 * The screen-assembly seam — UI-generation blueprint §1 point 2 and §4.2.
 *
 * "The seam routes, not the caller." No agent chooses "quick screen" vs "real
 * build": every `vendo_make` request starts in the screen agent, and an
 * escalation is how it asks for the builder.
 *
 * The screen agent itself is a lean loop in `@vendoai/harnesses` — it needs a
 * model, the guard-bound registry, and a workspace whose commits reach the render
 * seam, none of which `@vendoai/apps` holds. `apps` depends on `core` alone, so
 * the two sides meet on this interface and composition (`packages/vendo`) is the
 * only place that fills the slot. That is the shipped adapter rule: an explicitly
 * passed adapter always wins and there is no hidden key-conditional branch. What
 * an unfilled slot no longer does is quietly hand the ask to a second engine —
 * `vendo_make` says it could not build the screen instead.
