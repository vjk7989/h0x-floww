/**
 * THE SLOTS — every place the Kit takes an ELEMENT instead of a value, in one
 * table. The generated prompt teaches from it and the nesting check enforces
 * it: an element under a key that is NOT declared here is refused rather than
 * dropped at render, which is the silent-breakage class this floor exists for.
 * A slot's key is the last segment of where the element sits, so `columns[].cell`
 * and `marker` are the slots `cell` and `marker`.
 *
 * THE LAW: a slot is declared here only when the React component RENDERS it —
 * a `ReactNode` prop it actually paints (`@vendoai/ui`). Teaching a slot the Kit
 * does not implement is worse than teaching none: the prompt tells the model to
 * write it, every check passes it, and the renderer drops it in silence. That is
 * the same silent-breakage this table exists to refuse, arriving through the
 * table itself. `@vendoai/ui`'s `test/kit/slot-drift.test.tsx` puts a probe in
 * every slot declared here and fails unless it finds it in the DOM, so the two
 * move together at every merge.
 *
 * WHAT a slot holds is not declared: any Kit element may sit in any slot, the
 * way it may in normal React. Where each one BELONGS is the model's design
 * judgement, and the judge's to grade.
