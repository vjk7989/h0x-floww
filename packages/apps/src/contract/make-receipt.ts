/**
 * What `vendo_make` hands back — contract §3.1.
 *
 * The old tools returned the entire `AppDocument`: the tree, the island sources,
 * the storage declarations, the machine reference. So a calling agent was handed
 * UI and had to be trusted not to describe it, retell it, or invent from it — and
 * a model handed a tree will eventually talk about the tree. Pixels go server →
 * slot; the agent only ever gets words.
 *
 * Four fields, and the laws that go with them:
 *
 * 1. **Never UI.** No tree, no payload, no URL, no component names. The screen
 *    arrives on its own channel; this says only that it is coming.
 * 2. **`say` is the BUILDER's own words, and the agent utters them verbatim.**
 *    Consumer voice. No time estimates, no cost, no "would you like me to…".
 *    On the assembly route it is the screen agent's closing text
 *    (`ScreenOutcome.say`), because only the thing that built the screen knows
 *    what is on it: which saves painted, and what each query delivered. A
 *    sentence composed here from the app's name alone gave the calling agent a
 *    title and no facts, and it invented the rest.
 * 3. **`"building"` is an honest answer.** An escalated build is not finished when
 *    the call returns, and pretending otherwise is what makes an agent narrate a
 *    screen that is not there yet.
 * 4. **`"partial"` is the other honest answer.** The screen landed and the server
 *    work its plan required did not, so the person is looking at sections with
 *    nothing behind them. `"ready"` here was the original silent-success bug one
 *    field over: the `say` said "the server-side part didn't get built" while
 *    anything BRANCHING on `status` — a host, the pack's ref capture, an outside
 *    agent over MCP — read plain success off a half-built app (2026-08-11). Not
 *    `"failed"`, which means nothing is painted and sends the agent to rebuild:
 *    this view is real, reopenable, and worth keeping.
 * 5. **A BUILD never gets a receipt at all.** A build spends a machine, and FINAL
 *    SPEC v1's law is that no machine is spent without the person's explicit yes
 *    — so the tool parks the ask and answers with the standard `pending-approval`
 *    outcome, which is what every consent surface already routes on. There was an
 *    `"awaiting-consent"` status here, and it was a receipt saying `status: "ok"`:
 *    invisible to the card, to the MCP door and to every other reader that
 *    branches on the outcome. Not `"building"` either, which would have the agent
 *    narrate work nobody has authorized yet.
