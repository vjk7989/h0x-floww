 * `@vendoai/apps/contract` — the app format, browser-safe.
 *
 * Everything a surface needs to SPEAK about a generated app: the document
 * envelope, the tree, the kit vocabulary, the in-client module rules, catalog +
 * theme, the checking contract, remix provenance,
 * and the wire shapes `/apps/*` returns. No node built-ins, no model, no store —
 * this door is importable from a browser bundle, which is why `@vendoai/ui`
 * reaches app-generation only through it (enforced in `scripts/dependency-guard.mjs`).
 *
 * The behavior that PRODUCES these shapes lives behind the package root
 * (`@vendoai/apps`), which is node-only.

// door is what matters, so it is re-exported here and consumers read one place.
