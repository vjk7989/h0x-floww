/**
 * The view channel's contract: what a compiled screen looks like on its way to a
 * slot.
 *
 * Before this, the channel carried `UIPayload` — `{ formatVersion: string;
 * [key: string]: unknown }`, an open bag whose seven real fields were read by
 * inline cast at each consumer. A deployed host frontend had nothing to hold us
 * to. This declares the fields, and versions them: renderers dispatch on
 * `formatVersion`, an unregistered tag is a contained failure, additive fields are
 * fine, and a changed or removed field means a NEW tag.
 *
 * Two laws are in the shape itself:
 *
 * 1. **No data.** A description says what to fetch (`queries`), never what came
 *    back. The slot asks for its own values, as the viewer, through the one
 *    guarded query path. `data` on this channel would be a server deciding what a
 *    viewer may see at paint time instead of at ask time, so the schema refuses
 *    the key outright rather than merely omitting it.
 * 2. **No islands.** `components`/`componentTools` are not part of this contract.
 *    Legacy island apps keep flowing through the open payload shape they always
 *    did; nothing new enters through here.
