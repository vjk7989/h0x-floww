/**
 * The screen engine's vocabulary — what a running screen hands back.
 *
 * A generated screen is a React component the model wrote. It runs inside a
 * sealed QuickJS VM (./boot.ts) and never touches a real DOM: what comes out is
 * DATA — a tree of component names and props, plus the tool calls its event
 * handlers asked for. The host renders that tree with its own components and
 * decides which tool calls are allowed to happen.
 *
 * Two things the shapes below encode:
 *
 * 1. **A handler is a reference, not a function.** A function cannot cross the
 *    VM boundary, so a function-valued prop is emitted as {@link HandlerRef} —
 *    `{ $handler: "h4" }` — and the renderer turns it back into a callback that
 *    calls {@link ScreenInstance.fire}. Handler ids are stable across
 *    re-renders by structural position, so a click already in flight still
 *    names the same handler after the screen repaints.
 * 2. **A tool call is an intent, not an effect.** `tools.cancel_transfer(...)`
 *    inside a handler records an {@link Intent} and returns a promise that
 *    stays pending. Nothing happens until the host runs the real tool and
 *    reports back through {@link ScreenInstance.settle}. The screen cannot
 *    reach the network, so this is the only way anything leaves it.
