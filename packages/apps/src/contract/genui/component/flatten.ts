/**
 * The nested paint, flattened into addressable nodes.
 *
 * A renderer wants two things the nested tree cannot give it: a name for every
 * node it can hold onto, and a way to reach one node without walking to it. An
 * id from the STRUCTURAL PATH gives both — and because the path uses the
 * component's `key` wherever it wrote one, the id of a row survives a repaint
 * that inserts a row above it. Downstream that id becomes the React key, so
 * state inside the rendered kit (an open menu, a focused input, a scroll
 * position) survives the repaint too. An id built from a running counter would
 * not: every row below the insert would be renamed and remounted.
 *
 * The format reads as the walk that produced it — `root.0.Card:tr_129.1`.
 *
 * The VM's handler ids are minted against the SAME path (plus the prop name),
 * so a node's id and the ids of its handlers agree by construction.
 *
 * THE ONE CAVEAT, and the reason a key is worth writing: a position is a
 * position. A keyless sibling that appears — the `{error && <Banner/>}` above a
 * list — renumbers every keyless sibling after it, so those ids change and the
 * kit remounts them. React has the same property, which is why keys exist;
 * anything conditional or repeated wants one.

/**
 * Flatten one paint. Total and pure: every node in, every node out, ids
 * deterministic for an unchanged position.
 *
 * A text child becomes a node of its own — component {@link SCREEN_TEXT_NODE},
 * its text in `props.text` — so `children` is unambiguously a list of ids and a
 * renderer never has to guess whether `"root"` is an id or the word.
 *
 * Two siblings written with the SAME key would claim one id (React warns about
 * exactly this); the second and later take a `~2` suffix rather than
 * overwriting the first, so a duplicate key costs stability, never a node.
 *
 * `source` is whoever asked for the paint saying what this SCREEN is, stamped on
 * every node it emits — the VM emits elements, not provenance, so there is no
 * finer truth to be had here. The gauntlet is the only hand that sets it, and it
 * sets it off the DIALECT the screen was type-checked in
 * (server/checking/screen-typings.ts), which is what actually holds the class
 * boundary; a screen has no way to name its own.
