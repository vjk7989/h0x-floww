/**
 * The program that runs INSIDE the VM — as source text, because that is the
 * only thing a QuickJS context accepts.
 *
 * Three layers, evaluated in this order by ./boot.ts:
 *
 *   1. {@link sealSource}     — what the VM must not have.
 *   2. {@link SCREEN_RUNTIME} — Preact, a fake host to render into, and the
 *                               recorder that turns a render into data.
 *   3. {@link installSource}  — this screen's data, this screen's component,
 *                               and the first paint.
 *
 * THE RECORDER. Preact needs a DOM. It gets ~60 lines of one (`document`
 * creates plain objects; `insertBefore`/`removeChild` splice arrays) — enough
 * for the differ to commit and reorder, and nothing more. But the emitted tree
 * is read off the committed VNODE tree, not off those objects, because the DOM
 * is the wrong place to read props from: `setAttribute` stringifies, so
 * `amount_cents={4200}` would come back `"4200"`, and Preact deliberately drops
 * a function-valued prop that is not an `on*` event, which is exactly the
 * handler drawer's input. The vnode carries what the component actually wrote.
 *
 * The price is two of Preact's minified internals — `vnode.__k` (children) and
 * `container.__k` (the root) — and the price is affordable because Preact's
 * bytes are VENDORED, verbatim and pinned, in ./preact-source.ts: they cannot
 * move under this file without someone regenerating that one.
 *
 * NO CLOCK, NO TIMERS, NO SCHEDULER. Preact's two scheduling seams —
 * `options.debounceRendering` (state updates) and `options.requestAnimationFrame`
 * (passive effects) — are pointed at one in-VM queue that the host drains, so a
 * `setState` and a `useEffect` both land synchronously and in order, with no
 * `setTimeout` in the VM at all. `act()` in Preact's own test utilities is the
 * same trick.

/**
 * The names the VM must NOT carry — and the two it may hold only from the host.
 *
 * `Date` and `Math.random` are `$expr`'s two deletions, for `$expr`'s reason: a
 * screen that reads them paints differently on two identical renders. Timers
 * join them here — a screen paints from data and events, and a `setTimeout`
 * inside a VM the host drives by hand is a scheduled event nobody will ever
 * run. Each is REPLACED rather than deleted where a message helps: "not a
 * function" tells whoever repairs the screen nothing.
 *
 * `console` is the exception that is added rather than removed: a stray
 * `console.log` is not a capability, and a bare context has no `console`, so
 * without this one a debug line the model forgot to delete is a ReferenceError
 * that takes the whole screen down.
 *
 * The frozen clock and {@link INTL_SOURCE} are the other shape of the same rule:
 * both are things a screen genuinely needs, both would read the machine the VM
 * happens to run on, so both are answered by the HOST instead — the clock as one
 * pinned instant, `Intl` across the wall.

/**
 * Real `Intl`, borrowed from the host.
 *
 * QuickJS is built without ICU: there is no `Intl` in here at all, and the
 * `toLocaleString` family it does carry degrades to `toString()`. So the idiom
 * every model was trained on —
 * `cents.toLocaleString("en-US", { style: "currency", currency: "USD" })`,
 * `new Date(row.due).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short", day: "numeric" })`
 * — painted `4200` and a full ISO stamp where a browser paints `$4,200.00` and
 * `Aug 17`. Every name below therefore exists, and every one of them is answered
 * ACROSS THE WALL by the host's own `Intl` (./boot.ts `answerIntl`) through the
 * same synchronous host function the tool bridge is built from. Formatted text is
 * text, so nothing new crosses.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED. A locale or a `timeZone` the screen NAMES is honoured — it wrote
 * it. What it leaves out comes from the host's boot options and never from the
 * machine the VM happens to be running on, so one screen over one set of data
 * prints the same string on a laptop in Cairo and on a worker in Iowa.
 *
 * A VALUE CROSSES AS TEXT. JSON has no `NaN` and no `Infinity`, and `Intl` prints
 * both ("NaN", "∞"); as JSON they would arrive as `null` and format as zero — a
 * date in 1970 where a browser throws. So a value rides as its decimal spelling
 * and the host reads it back with `Number`.
 *
 * THE SURFACE IS THE TYPINGS' SURFACE, EXACTLY. What a screen may write is what
 * `lib.es2020.d.ts` declares (server/checking/screen-typings.ts
 * `COMPONENT_SCREEN_LIB`), so every value-side name in that lib's `Intl` is here
 * and nothing else is: `Collator`, `DateTimeFormat`, `DisplayNames`, `Locale`,
 * `NumberFormat`, `PluralRules`, `RelativeTimeFormat`, `getCanonicalLocales`,
 * each with the methods that lib gives it. A name the lib admits and this file
 * omits is a screen that passes every gate and then dies on its first paint with
 * "not a function" — the pre-bridge trap, reborn on the edges — and a name here
 * that the lib does not declare is unreachable code. `screen-intl-parity.test.ts`
 * walks both sides and refuses any difference, in either direction; `ListFormat`,
 * `Segmenter` and the `formatRange` family are absent here because that lib does
 * not declare them, and adding them means moving the lib pin first.
