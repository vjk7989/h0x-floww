/**
 * The host half of the screen engine: one sealed VM, one running screen.
 *
 * A generated screen is a React component. This runs it — really runs it, real
 * Preact, real hooks, real re-renders — inside a QuickJS WebAssembly VM, and
 * hands back DATA: the tree it painted and the tool calls its handlers asked
 * for. The screen has no DOM, no network, no clock and no host object, because
 * none of them exist in there. It is the same seal `$expr` keeps (../expr.ts)
 * with the same variant and the same discipline; this is its sibling, sized for
 * a component instead of an expression.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF A TURN. Everything is synchronous, and every turn is the same
 * three steps: push something in (mount, an event, a tool's answer), drain
 * everything the screen scheduled off the back of it, read the paint out. The
 * drain is where Preact's state updates and passive effects run — pointed at an
 * in-VM queue this file pumps (./vm-program.ts), so a `setState` inside a
 * handler has already landed by the time `fire` returns.
 *
 * THE BUDGET IS THE VENUE'S TO CHOOSE. A deadline is the question actually
 * being asked — until the venue is one that freezes the clock while a screen
 * burns, where it is a question that can only be answered "not yet". So the
 * limit arrives as a {@link ScreenBudget} (./budget.ts): wall-clock by default,
 * interrupt counts where the clock does not move.
 *
 * A THROW LEAVES THE SCREEN STANDING. A handler that throws, or that never
 * finishes, raises a {@link ScreenError} out of `fire` — and the instance stays
 * usable, still showing the tree it last painted. That is the honest answer for
 * a surface: one broken button does not take the screen down. The exception is
 * `kind: "vm"`, where the VM itself failed and nothing in it can be trusted.
