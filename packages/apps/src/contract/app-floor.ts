 * contract between them lives here on the browser-safe contract door, beside
 * {@link Finding} and {@link Check}, for the same reason those do: both sides
 * already speak the contract.
 *
 * One method: the component-screen gauntlet. The AI reviewer is deliberately NOT
 * part of it — it spends a model call, and the seam runs on every commit.
 * Judgment belongs to `validate`.
