/**
 * The screen VM, on a WebAssembly module the host compiled at deploy time.
 *
 * The default engine is the SINGLE-FILE build, where the WebAssembly rides
 * inside the JavaScript as a base64 string and is compiled from those bytes at
 * runtime (contract/genui/component/boot.ts:73-88). workerd does not allow that:
 * a Worker may only instantiate a `WebAssembly.Module` that its own deployment
 * imported. So the edge leg takes the module as an ARGUMENT and wraps the
 * wasmfile variant around it — the platform's import stays the platform's, and
 * this package never touches a `.wasm` file.
 *
 * ONE VARIANT PER ISOLATE, held right here at module scope. `warmScreenEngine`
 * memoizes an engine per variant in an unbounded `Map` with no eviction
 * (boot.ts:68), so a host that built a fresh variant per request would leak a
 * whole QuickJS module every time. A module-level slot makes that unreachable:
 * a deployment has one `.wasm`, so it gets one variant and one engine, whatever
 * a caller does with `edgeToolchain`.
