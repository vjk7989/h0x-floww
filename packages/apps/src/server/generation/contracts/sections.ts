/**
 * The one prompt piece that is HOST CONFIGURATION rather than engine text: the

 * What used to live here — the role line, the v2 tree contract, the host tool and

 * silently diverging source of truth about a tree nothing in this package writes
 * any more.
 *
 * The theme/design-rules pair left with it: what a writer is told about this
 * host is now ONE assembly, `contract/briefing.ts`'s `renderBriefingPack`, and
 * a second rendering of the same two config keys is exactly what that file
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * What survives is what a LIVE reader still asks for: `componentsPromptSection`
 * for the shipped skill's `references/format.md`.
