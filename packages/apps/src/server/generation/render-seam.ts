/**
 * The hot-path render seam — build contract §1.6.
 *
 * The runtime is the one place that knows a screen landed, so the runtime is the
 * one place that emits: every store write to `app.tsx` goes through the checks
 * floor's component gauntlet here and, iff it paints, becomes today's
 * `data-vendo-view` part — same payload shape, same stable per-app stream id,
 * same server-authoritative field stripping. A write that does not paint emits
 * NOTHING: the last good view stays on screen and the brokenness reaches the
 * harness through `validate`, never the user.
 *
 * `HarnessEvent` stays closed — a harness cannot yield a view, by construction.
 *
 * The interception point is **`commit()`** (orchestrator seam answer, 2026-07-30,
 * after lane B landed): the workspace façade STAGES writes in memory, so a
 * `writeFile` is not a store write — `commit()` is, and `CommitResult.changed`
 * names exactly the paths that reached the store. Hooking the write instead would
 * emit views for content that never landed, and would miss the sandbox sync-back
 * path, which commits without ever calling `writeFile` on this façade.
 *
 * That last clause is why the app's own SOURCE is persisted from here too
 * (contract §2.2/§3.2, the `commitSource` seam): a builder working inside a box
 * reaches the store through this same `commit()`, so this is the one place that
 * sees its files at all. Before it, an app's code lived only in the sandbox
 * snapshot behind `machine.snapshotRef` — lose the snapshot, lose the app.
