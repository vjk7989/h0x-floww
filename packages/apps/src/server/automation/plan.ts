"task" is {"kind":"steps","steps":[{"id":"<bare identifier>","tool":"<tool name>","args":{...}?,"if":"<jsonata>"?,"forEach":"<jsonata>"?}, ...]}.
- Every step's "tool" MUST be a name from the TOOLS list; anything else is invalid. Steps run in order.
- Choose tools that FULFILL the instruction: read live data with the host/connected READ tools (live data NEVER comes from "${RESULTS_TOOL}"-style app collections), and make the changes it asks for with the write tools in the list.
- NOTHING IRREVERSIBLE RUNS AWAY. Sending, messaging, paying and deleting are not in the TOOLS list and never will be: Vendo does not do a thing it cannot take back while nobody is watching. Author the part that CAN run unattended — read, decide, publish the result — and leave the irreversible part out. The person does that part themselves, on demand, from the app.
- EVERY value inside "args" is a JSON STRING containing a JSONATA expression evaluated against {event, steps, item} — never a bare number, boolean, object, or array. A prior step's output is "steps.<stepId>...". A literal string is single-quoted INSIDE the string ("'like this'"); a literal number is written as its expression ("20"); an object is built in jsonata ("{\\"count\\": $count(steps.rows.items)}").
- "if" skips the step unless the jsonata expression is truthy. "forEach" is a jsonata expression producing an array; the step runs once per element with that element bound to item (max 1000).
- RESULTS: the app's board reads a TABLE in the app's own database, not run logs. The LAST step MUST persist the displayable result through tool "${RESULTS_TOOL}" with args ${resultsPublishArgs(input.appId, "<table>")} — the table already exists with columns (id, data), the id is always 'latest', and the second parameter is a jsonata expression for the displayable result. Set the top-level "resultsCollection" to that table name.
EXAMPLE (shape only — use the real tools and the real request):
{"name":"Morning digest","when":"0 8 * * *","task":{"kind":"steps","steps":[{"id":"rows","tool":"host_list_things"},{"id":"summary","tool":"host_things_summarize","args":{"count":"$count(steps.rows.items)"}},{"id":"publish","tool":"${RESULTS_TOOL}","args":{"appId":"'${input.appId}'","sql":"'${resultsStatement("digest")}'","params":"['latest', $string(steps.rows)]"}}]},"resultsCollection":"digest"}`;

- NOTHING IRREVERSIBLE RUNS AWAY. The tools that send, message, pay or delete are not in the TOOLS list, so the prompt must not ask for them: Vendo does not do a thing it cannot take back while nobody is watching. Have the agent read, judge, and publish what it found; the person acts on it themselves, on demand.
- RESULTS: when the app's board should show the outcome, the prompt must ALSO instruct the agent to persist the displayable result through tool "${RESULTS_TOOL}" with appId "${input.appId}", the statement \`${resultsStatement("<table>")}\` and params ['latest', <the result as a string>] — and set the top-level "resultsCollection" to that table name.`;
