/**
 * The automation door's lane: author one automation for an app, land the app's
 * own note of it, and arm it.
 *
 * This is a DOOR, not a rung. It used to hang off the escalation ladder as
 * `<Server kind="steps"|"agentic">` — the same ladder that reaches for a
 * machine — which meant "run this every morning" travelled the road built for
 * "this needs a server". Escalation now means the box and nothing else, and
 * authoring an automation is its own small entry point: no machine, no
 * sandbox, seconds rather than minutes.
 *
 * An automation is a RECORD of its own, owned by the principal who asked for it
 * and carrying no reference back to any app. What the app keeps is a list of
 * ids, maintained here and nowhere else, resolved on read with dead ids dropped.
 * So deleting the app does not stop the automation: it fires and fails loudly at
 * tool resolution, in the run ledger, which is the designed behavior.
