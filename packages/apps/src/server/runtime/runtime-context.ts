/**
 * The slice of `createApps`' closure its modules read.
 *
 * `createApps` is an ASSEMBLER: every door it returns, and every helper those
 * doors lean on, lives in a module beside its contract and is handed the pieces
 * of the closure it needs. Every one of them names its dependencies as a `Pick`
 * of this one type, and returns a `Pick` of it too, which keeps a single
 * description of what the closure offers and lets `createRuntimeContext` below
 * wire them in dependency order.
