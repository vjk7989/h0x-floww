/**
 * The host's mounted slots, as ROWS — the registry a surface reports itself
 * into, so anything that offers to build for a slot can name the real ones.
 *
 * A slot exists because a page RENDERS it, and nothing announces when one is
 * taken off a page: a row written once would outlive its surface forever. So
 * every render reports the slot again, refreshing `lastSeen`, and the read
 * filters on it — a slot that stopped rendering ages out of the registry on its
 * own after {@link SLOT_DECAY_MS}.
 *
 * The rows live in the GENERIC records collection, like the placement rows
 * beside them (`placements.ts`): `vendo_slots` is neither reserved nor
 * dedicated (`packages/store/src/routing.ts`), so it routes to `vendo_records`
 * on every adapter with no migration to run.
 *
 * `refs` carries `subject` and nothing else — the key the erase cascade matches
 * (`vendo_records WHERE refs @> '{"subject": …}'::jsonb`, `packages/store/src/
 * erase.ts`), and the only query this surface ever makes.
