// units) can never legally take a fractional number — a fractional value in
// that slot is a dollar amount by construction (cents are integers), so the
// call is rejected with a teaching error BEFORE the guard parks it. The
// integer case (25 meaning $25) is NOT decidable at this seam (25 is valid
// cents) — that class is covered by the unit-annotated tool sketches and the
// island contract's conversion rule in the generation prompts.
