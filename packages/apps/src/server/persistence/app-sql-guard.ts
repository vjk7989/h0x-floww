/**
 * The door. Everything an app's SQL is allowed to say, and the ONE place
 * `mine.` becomes one person's rows.
 *
 * Generated SQL is HOSTILE INPUT. What keeps one person out of another's rows
 * is not anything the model writes, and not a privilege of the host's database
 * either — a BYO Postgres url is very often a superuser, and a fence that
 * evaporates when the operator's role is too strong is not a fence. So the
 * fence is NAME RESOLUTION, in four layers:
 *
 *   1. `mine.x` and `shared.x` are the only table addresses that exist. They
 *      become physical names carrying a ":" — a character no identifier this
 *      grammar admits can contain — so a physical table has no spelling inside
 *      an app's SQL, and one person's tables have no spelling in another's.
 *   2. Unqualified names resolve inside the app's own namespace and nowhere
 *      else (the adapter's half), so a name that somehow got past layer 1 still
 *      cannot leave the app.
 *   3. Any qualifier that is not `mine`/`shared` is handed back to the caller,
 *      which refuses it when the database says it names a real schema. Table
 *      aliases pass; `public.vendo_records` does not.
 *   4. ONE statement, from a short allowlist, with no session, role, schema or
 *      catalog verb anywhere in it.
 *
 * Anything this file cannot account for is REFUSED, never guessed at.
