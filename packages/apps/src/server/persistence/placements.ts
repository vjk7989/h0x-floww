/**
 * "Show this app in that slot", as ROWS.
 *
 * A placement used to be a string on the app document (`doc.placements`),
 * which meant slot discovery had to list every app the person owned and scan
 * it, a slot could not show a build that had not landed yet (no document, no
 * placement), and eviction was a read-modify-write across other people's rows.
 *
 * The rows live in the GENERIC records collection — like this package's own
 * egress-approval rows (`egress-approval.ts`), and unlike the app-GRANT rows,
 * which earned a dedicated table (`packages/store/src/routing.ts`
 * RESERVED_COLLECTIONS). One adapter interface, so this behaves identically on
 * the local PGlite store, a BYO Postgres, and the Cloud hosted store — none of
 * which shares a schema migration path.
 *
 * TWO rows per slot, because one row cannot answer both questions at once:
 *
 *   pointer  `plc:<subject>:<slot>`          — WHO holds the slot, and under
 *                                              which token. The only
 *                                              arbitration point, so the
 *                                              eviction receipt is one CAS.
 *   live     `plcv:<subject>:<slot>:<token>` — exists iff THAT placement still
 *                                              holds the slot.
 *
 * The slot is occupied iff the live row the pointer names exists. Splitting
 * them is what makes a clear safe: a clear deletes the token'd live row, and a
 * token is never reused, so a stale client's delete can only ever hit its OWN
 * placement — never the app that replaced it. Keyed on the shared
 * (subject, slot) pair alone, that delete lands on whatever now occupies the
 * id, which is exactly the row it must not touch.
 *
 * A clear takes the pointer with it, but ONLY while the pointer still names
 * the token being cleared: an emptied slot must cost no row, and the token
 * check is what keeps that from evicting whoever took the slot in between.
 *
 * `refs` is the queryable key on both: `subject` is what the erase cascade
 * matches (`vendo_records WHERE refs @> '{"subject": …}'::jsonb` —
 * `packages/store/src/erase.ts`), `{subject, slot}` is the GIN-indexed pair a
 * slot query reads, and `app_id` is what app deletion sweeps on (the same ref
 * name `egress-approval.ts` clears an app by) — a shared app is placed by
 * people its owner cannot enumerate.
