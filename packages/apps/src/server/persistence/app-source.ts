/**
 * Checkout and commit — contract §3.2.
 *
 * The workspace is a working COPY, not a second owner: the row (id + doc) is the
 * truth, a checkout projects it onto a filesystem, and a commit diffs the
 * projection back.
 *
 * Three things this deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * - It never touches the HOT path. `app.tsx` keeps the render seam's behaviour
 *   exactly: the commit leaves it alone, because the seam already owns what
 *   happens when it lands.
 * - It never invents a spill. Source past the inline cap goes through the SAME
 *   `FilesAdapter` the workspace rows spill to.
 * - It never reads or writes any field but `source`. `trigger` above all travels
 *   untouched, along with storage, machine, pins, placements and grants — a
 *   commit is not a generation.
