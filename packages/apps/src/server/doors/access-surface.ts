  /**
   * "Share implies promote" (ruled 2026-08-01, pinned at
   * conformance/app-access.ts:181-201). Every create path stamps an app with the
   * PERSON, and core refuses a tenant grant on a still-personal app — the app's
   * documents live under the holder's own `/user` mount, so a share that skipped
   * the move would hand the recipient an empty app. So the share moves it first,
   * in `lifecycle.promote`'s one transaction.
   *
   * ORDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. The move restamps the row's subject as the org id,
   * which retires the promoter's ownership fast path (access-checks.ts:65) — so
   * an owner who is not a tenant ADMIN would lose the app she just shared. Her
   * own owner grant is therefore minted BEFORE the flip, the deliberate
   * exception pinned at store helpers/app-access.ts:186-188.
   *
   * With no `ops` (a store offering neither its own ops nor a SQL handle) there
   * is nothing to move with, and core's own refusal below is the honest answer.
   *
   * NOT ATOMIC with the grant that follows it, and knowingly so. If that last
   * write fails, the app is left in the tenant carrying the sharer's owner grant
   * and no tenant grant, so the tenant's ADMINS can reach it while the caller
   * saw an error. Every alternative is worse. The order is FORCED: the tenant
   * grant cannot go first (core refuses a tenant principal that is not the org
   * holding the row, helpers/app-access.ts:186-188 — that IS the 2026-08-01
   * ruling), and the owner grant cannot go after (paragraph above). One
   * transaction is not on offer either — `AppAccess` is an adapter interface
   * with no transaction, so a hosted or BYO grant write can never join
   * `promote`'s. That leaves a compensating demote: surface the plan excludes,
   * reversing a saga over workspace documents, appData, blobs and bearer tokens,
   * whose own half-failure would be worse than the window it repairs. So the
   * window is ACCEPTED, and kept small by what surrounds it — the target is the
   * caller's own tenant (`requireMembership`), the exposure is that tenant's
   * admins rather than its membership, and the caller keeps owner, so retrying
   * the same share closes it: `promote` is idempotent and the grant write is one
   * derived-id row.
