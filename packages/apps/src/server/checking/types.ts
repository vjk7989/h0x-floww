/**
 * The checking floor's contract. The shapes themselves live in core
 * (`@vendoai/core` `pack.ts`, build contract §5) because a pack is how a host
 * plugs a check in, and a pack must be authorable without depending on the apps
 * block. This file re-exports them so the floor's own modules read naturally,
 * and adds the one shape that belongs to the floor rather than to the contract:
 * the assembled layer.
 *
 * A check REPORTS; it never throws. What it reports is not advice: at the
 * commit path a `block` stops the write (`runtime.ts` — nothing is persisted on
 * create, and on edit the previous app is left in its row, still serving). A
 * `warn` rides along on an app that ships.
