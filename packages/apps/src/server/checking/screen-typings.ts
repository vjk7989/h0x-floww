/**
 * Schema-derived TypeScript declarations for one screen — the static half of
 * the checks floor.
 *
 * The floor already knows every type a screen file can name: the Kit's props
 * are zod (`core` `kit/specs.ts`), a host component's props are the JSON Schema
 * derived once at composition (`NormalizedCatalogEntry.propsJsonSchema`), and a
 * query's result is the tool's declared `outputSchema`. This module turns all
 * of that into ambient declaration text so `tsc` — the real compiler, not a
 * bespoke walker — decides whether a screen names components that exist, sets
 * props that exist with types that fit, reaches fields the data really carries,
 * and aggregates over field names the rows really have.
 *
 * Everything here is DERIVED. No hand-written component list, no hand-written
 * prop list: the component vocabulary comes from `KIT_SCREEN_COMPONENT_NAMES` + the
 * catalog. There is no CALL vocabulary to declare any more — a `{...}` gap is a
 * JavaScript expression, so `invoices.data.reduce((t, r) => t + r.amount, 0)`
 * type-checks against the query's own declared result type with nothing
 * ambient in the way. The old `sum`/`count`/`group_by`/`pick` declarations
 * existed only to give tsc a shape for a closed dialect that no longer exists;
 * shipping them now would type-check calls the renderer cannot evaluate.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: same input, byte-identical output. No compiler, no
 * I/O — {@link screenTscFindings} in screen-tsc.ts is the half that runs one.

 *  ignore it, and the return covers both `() => setOpen(true)` and an `async`
 *  handler that awaits a tool.
 *
 *  `value` is `any` deliberately. What a control reports is not a string — a
 *  Slider gives a number, a multi-select an array (`specs.ts`) — and the type
 *  no control's data really has closed the one route a picked value has to a

 *  it into a value-based element's props and never into an intrinsic tag's,
 *  which take `IntrinsicElements[tag]` verbatim. Declaring `key` in one place
 *  only made `key={i}` on `<div>` a hard error while the format skill was

 *
 *  THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is a whole DIALECT rather than a prop: a screen the
 *  splitter PORTED out of real host source carries the host's own classes, and
 *  without them it cannot look like the component it was ported from. So `ported`
 *  prints `className` and the model-authored dialect does not print it at all.

 *  instruction, and a model that ignores it gets the capability anyway. A class
 *  it cannot write is a class it cannot borrow the host's chrome with — and even
 *  in the ported dialect the class is inert text that only reaches a DOM node on
 *  a `source: "ported"` node (`packages/ui` tree/display-bricks.tsx), with every
 *  style still going through that file's property allowlist.
 *
 *  `Element` is BRANDED rather than empty. `{}` is the type every value is
 *  assignable to — a closure included — so an empty `Element` made
 *  {@link SLOT_TYPE} admit every function, including the two it must refuse: one
 *  that reads a row where there is no row, and one that returns no element. A JSX
 *  expression is typed `JSX.Element` by the compiler whatever its shape, so the
