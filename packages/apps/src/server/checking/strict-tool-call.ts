/**
 * One model call whose answer is a TOOL CALL, not prose: the model is given
 * exactly one tool, told it must call it, and its arguments are validated
 * against the schema by the provider (Anthropic strict tool use). That is what
 * makes a closed answer space actually closed — a free-text answer can always
 * drift outside it.
 *
 * The AI reviewer (./reviewer.ts) is the one caller: its findings are a flat,
 * schema-pinned array. Everything here degrades to `undefined` rather than
 * throwing — a judgment call that could not be made is never a reason to throw a
 * generated app away.
 *
 * It lives beside its caller rather than in `generation/`: the floor must not
 * import a pipeline that is on its way to quarantine (§7.3).
