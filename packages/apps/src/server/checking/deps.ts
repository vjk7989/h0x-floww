 * this directory says the floor dereferences exactly FOUR fields, so those four
 * are the type. `GenerationDependencies` extends it, so every conductor call site
 * keeps working unchanged — and the floor now runs anywhere a catalog and a model
 * exist, which is what lets it move to the paint seam.
