/**
 * The save-time gauntlet for a COMPONENT screen — the new artifact: one plain
 * `.tsx` file, one default-exported React component, data through
 * `useQuery("tool_name", input?)`, actions through
 * `tools.tool_name(args)` inside handlers, and nothing imported but `react` and
 * `@vendo/screen`.
 *
 * Six stages, and the order is not a preference: a file that does not compile
 * has no AST to scan; a scan that cannot name the queries has no plan to
 * type-check against; a screen that does not type-check must never be EXECUTED;
 * and a screen whose tree is not a tree has no controls worth pressing. So each
 * stage is the next one's precondition and the first one that finds something is
 * the last one that runs.
 *
 *   1. COMPILE   esbuild, once per form (the CJS the engine evaluates, the
 *                module form the scan reads).
 *   2. SCAN      the two rules a compiler cannot state: the import surface is
 *                exactly two modules, and every query names a read tool with a
 *                literal name. Plus the `tools` discipline — literal member
 *                access, called from a handler, never mid-render.
 *   3. TYPECHECK the real compiler, against declarations derived from the Kit's
 *                zod specs and the host tools' own schemas, with NO DOM lib —
 *                so `document`, `fetch` and `<div>` are errors because they
 *                genuinely do not exist here.
 *   4. RUN       execute the query plan for real, boot the screen on the answers,
 *                answer whatever reads the paint itself asks for, take its tree,
 *                and PRESS every control it drew.
 *   5. TREE      the tree validators the wire artifact already ships.
 *   6. CONTROLS  the presses stage 4 took: a control that asked for no tool and
 *                painted nothing new is a dead button, and it is refused.
 *
 * Every issue is written as a repair instruction. These messages are read by a
 * model, and a refusal that does not say what to write instead only costs a
 * round.
 *
 * The `.vendo` document checks (facts.ts) are untouched — this is the parallel
 * gauntlet for the new artifact, and it REUSES their machinery rather than
 * restating it: the same esbuild pattern, the same schema→TS printers
 * (screen-typings.ts), the same compiler harness (screen-tsc.ts), the same
 * `tools` literal-access scan (contract/island-ambient.ts), the same tree
 * validators (contract/genui/tree.ts + facts.ts), the same reviewer data
 * discipline (reviewer.ts).

 * construct is gone either way.
 *
 * Text matching is therefore the only reading available, and it is written to
 * fail CLOSED: `\s` on both sides so a brace on the next line still counts, and
 * a non-identifier lookbehind rather than a line anchor so `const x = 1;
 * namespace Foo {` is seen — those were misses, and a guard that misses admits
 * the very screen it exists to catch.
 *
 * The residual runs the other way, and it is the WHOLE of the author's file:
 * this reads raw text, so the words `namespace X {` are refused wherever they
 * appear — in a line comment, in a block comment, in a string, in a template
 * literal, in JSX text. Nothing here strips any of those, and a screen that
 * merely SAYS the construct is refused as if it declared one. That is the
 * accepted price: unlike the `static {}` guard, no AST can answer this, because
 * every toolchain erases the construct before there is a tree to read. A false
 * refusal costs one repair round on a screen nobody writes; a miss ships a
 * screen that paints differently in two venues. `scan-fidelity.test.ts` pins
 * this behaviour deliberately, so that closing it cannot silently reopen the
 * `namespace Foo\n{` miss.
 *
 * One residual runs the OTHER way and is accepted on the same terms: `\s` does
 * not match a comment, so a REAL declaration with a block comment between the
 * keyword, the name or the brace is admitted — those shapes pass the whole
 * gauntlet, which is a miss and not a false refusal. The
 * only fix is lexing the file to read through comments, and this guard exists
 * precisely because there is no parse of the construct to lean on. Pinned in the
 * same place as the false positives, so the accepted set is honest in both

/**
 * The two ways a paint can account for a field, read off the tree once.
 *
 * `named` is every string the paint carries in its props at any depth, because
 * that is how a Kit component says WHICH field it shows: a table's `columns`, a
 * card's `fields`, a KeyValue's `items` are field KEYS, and the values behind them
 * are never written out as text — they are handed over whole inside `rows`.
 *
 * `shown` is the other half: what the screen literally writes — a run of text, a
 * scalar prop — as the whole value and as its separate words, so a field that
 * arrives inside a sentence (`${build.author} shipped`) still counts as shown.
 *
 * They must stay two sets. Matching a value against every string in the tree would
 * count the raw rows a table was HANDED as painted, and the failure this whole
 * section exists for — eight fields fetched, three columns drawn — would be
 * invisible.
