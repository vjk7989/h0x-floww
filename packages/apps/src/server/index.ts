/**
 * `@vendoai/apps` — the app engine, node-only.
 *
 * The package root is the 06 §1 public API and nothing else. Everything the
 * runtime uses to get its work done — the generation engine, interchange
 * plumbing, persistence — is internal and reachable only through AppsRuntime.
 * A comment below each export block says why that block is public, because
 * "why is this public?" is the only question this file cannot answer itself.
 *
 * The FORMAT this engine produces lives on the browser-safe sibling door,
 * `@vendoai/apps/contract`. Anything a surface needs to speak about an app —
 * the document, the dialects, the kit, the wire shapes — is there, not here.
