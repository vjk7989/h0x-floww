/**
 * `references/format.md` — the `building-apps` skill's companion file: how to
 * write the screen. A FILE on the `/host` mount, read with the harness's own
 * hands, never listed.
 *
 * A screen is a plain React component now, so this file teaches only the DELTAS
 * from React a model already knows: the two imports, catalog-only components, a
 * write as one element, tool calls in handlers, no clock and no network, keys,
 * controlled inputs. Everything that used to live here — a markup dialect, its
 * attribute forms, its brace grammar, its island envelope — is gone with the
 * dialect, and teaching it would send a model writing a file nothing compiles.
 *
 * The component half is INTERPOLATED from the same generated schemas the engine's
 * workers read (`componentsPromptSection`), so it cannot drift from the code — and
 * it now teaches the same idiom this chapter does, so nothing here has to correct
 * it (`contract/kit/kit-prompt.ts`).
 *
 * The WORKED SCREENS are the other half of the teaching, and each one is there for
 * a shape a model does not reach for from prose: a total reduced off the rows and
 * repeated where it is acted on, a fixed column count for a compare-these ask, a
 * detail pane opened on the first row with the row action on every row. One stacked
 * card list was the only example for a while, and a stacked card list is what came
 * back. They are pinned in `tests/skills/format-reference.test.ts`, which runs each
 * of them through the real save-time gauntlet.

const CHAPTER = `# The screen file

- An app is ONE file: \`${APP_FILE}\`, in the app's own directory
  \`user/apps/app_<name>/\`.
- It holds a React component, default-exported.
- Saving it repaints the person's screen.

\`\`\`tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useQuery, tools, Stack, Text, Button } from "@vendo/screen";

export default function Overview() { … }
\`\`\`

Those two imports are everything there is. Nothing else can be loaded.

## Data — \`useQuery(tool_name, input)\`

- Synchronous, and it hands back the tool's result with the tool's own field
  names on it — read them off the tool's schema and COPY them. The shape is
  closed: a field you inferred from a sibling's name (\`amount_cents\` where the
  schema says \`amount\`) is a hard refusal, not an undefined value.
- A read whose input you COMPUTE has no answer on the first paint: its \`data\` is
  undefined until the host supplies it, and then every \`useQuery\` re-runs with
  the real thing. So write the screen so an unanswered read draws its empty shell
  — \`rows.data ?? []\`, an empty state, a panel with nothing in it yet.
- The input is any value you have: a piece of state, something you computed, a
  field off another query.
- Read the same tool twice with different inputs where the screen needs two
  answers.
- An id is not a name: a field ending in \`_id\` points into another tool's rows
  (\`release.owner_id\` → \`list_members\`), so read that tool and show the NAME. A
  screen about ONE record shows that record's own fields — who owns it included —
  not only the fields the ask spelled out.

## Actions — \`tools.<tool_name>(args)\`

- Inside an event handler only, never during render. \`await\` it when you need
  the result — but only a READ answers straight away.
- A WRITE is answered by the PERSON, not by the host: it comes back
  \`pending-approval\`, and the code after your \`await\` does not run until they
  answer — where nobody answers, it never runs at all. So a handler may FIRE
  writes and finish; it must never wait on one to do the next thing.
  \`for (const row of rows) await tools.remove({ id: row.id })\` sends the first
  call and stops there, and \`await tools.pay({}); setOpen(false)\` leaves the
  dialog standing. Fire every call in the one press, with no \`await\` between.
- When an awaited call succeeds, every \`useQuery\` on the screen re-runs and the
  screen re-renders with fresh data, keeping the state it had — never patch state
  to mirror what the refresh will bring back.
- Destructive and money-moving calls are confirmed by the product OUTSIDE your
  screen — the guard asks the person before the call runs — so never build a
  confirm step of your own: no "are you sure" panel, no second button, no
  \`confirming\` state.
- The exception: a confirmation the person ASKED for, or one press that fires a
  whole batch of calls. That one is part of their app, and the second worked
  screen below is its shape.
  - A guarded host still asks once per call on top of it, and that is the trade:
    only your Modal can say how many, and being asked twice beats a batch that
    goes out silently.
- Another exception: a confirmation THIS product's own rules require. When the
  host design rules in the brief name an action as confirm-first, that step is
  part of the app — build it. The guard's own ask counts where it fires; where
  it does not, yours is the one the rules asked for.
- THE ACTION THE ASK NAMED IS ALWAYS PRESSABLE. Never paint it \`disabled\`
  because the screen thinks the moment is wrong: someone who asked to cut a
  release, kick a review back or cancel a queue and finds the control greyed out
  has a screen that cannot do the job they asked for. Let the press land, and put
  the risk where they will read it — in the confirmation ("3 issues are still
  open; cutting now freezes them"), or in a Callout beside the control.
- A CONTROL YOU DO DISABLE SAYS WHAT IT IS WAITING FOR, on the screen, naming
  every missing piece — "Name it, and pick at least one condition" — and
  \`required\` on the fields that are. A form still filling in is the ONLY thing
  \`disabled\` is for. The ask's verb is never disabled — not on the screen, not
  on one row of a table, not on the row already open or already holding that
  status: a press that merely repeats is harmless, and a control that refuses
  it reads as broken.
- BUILD THE CONTROLS THE ASK ASKED FOR, AND NEVER A SECOND WAY TO DO THE SAME
  THING. "One button that cancels all of them" is ONE button: a per-row Cancel
  beside it is the same verb twice. A row action is for a verb the ask puts ON
  the row — "let me cancel one", "kick one back".
- A form that FILES a record shows a field for every argument the write takes —
  including the ones the ask already fixed, prefilled and editable. "Open a bug
  on the mobile team" arrives with Team reading \`mobile\`; hard-coding it in the
  call and printing it as a sentence takes away their ability to change it.
- An id argument carries the row's \`id\` field VERBATIM (\`bld_4188\`), never the
  number a person says ("build #4188") — the host knows its own ids, not your
  respelling of them.

## Components and plain HTML

- Prefer the catalog: its components carry this product's theme, and their props
  are checked.
- Beside it you have plain display HTML — \`${DISPLAY_TAG_NAMES.join("`, `")}\` — used the way you'd use
  it anywhere: headings, prose, lists, and any structure the catalog doesn't
  offer.
- Display tags take children and an inline \`style\`, nothing else — no handlers,
  so anything that ACTS is a component.
- Whatever you build yourself, style off the host's own CSS variables
  (\`var(--vendo-color-accent)\`, \`var(--vendo-density-content-gap)\`), never
  hard-coded values: a hard-coded color is your color, not the product's.
- Every variable there is, and what each one means, is listed at the end of this
  file.
- You format every figure yourself, with \`Intl\` — \`toLocaleString\`,
  \`toLocaleDateString\` — in the units the host stores and the currency the brief
  names. Components display and theme what you hand them; none of them formats.
  Read the unit off what the tool SAYS, not off the field's name: a field called
  plain \`amount\` whose description reads "\`amount\` is in CENTS: 285000 is
  $2,850.00" is cents everywhere you print it.
- A CHART IS NO EXCEPTION. It plots the raw numbers, and every figure it PRINTS —
  a slice's legend line, a bar's label, a hovered point, an x tick — comes from a
  \`format\` function you write, of the row:
  \`format={(row) => money(row.amount)}\` on a DonutChart,
  \`series={[{key:"amount",label:"Spend",format:(row) => money(row.amount)}]}\` on a
  Bar or Line chart, \`xFormat={(row) => day(row.month)}\` for the x axis. It is the
  same helper the table beside it uses.
- The ONE figure you cannot write is a value-axis tick: the chart invents those
  off the scale, and they read as the plotted numbers with digit grouping
  (285000 → "285,000"). So plot the units you want read — divide where you
  PREPARE the rows if the axis matters.

## The sandbox

- No network, no storage, no timers, no clock: no \`fetch\`, no \`localStorage\`,
  no \`setTimeout\`, no \`new Date()\`.
- A style that fetches (\`url(…)\`) is dropped.
- \`key={…}\` on every row you \`.map\`.

## Saving — \`vendo_apps_sql\`

\`useState\` holds what is on the screen right now, and it is gone the moment
they reload. Anything the person would expect to still be there tomorrow — their
rows, their edits, their settings — belongs in the app's own database. This app
has one, and it is real SQL.

- **Two table namespaces and no third**, and choosing between them IS the app's
  whole permission model — there is no other setting, and nothing asks the person
  later. \`mine.<table>\` is per-user: each person gets their own rows and no
  statement can reach anyone else's. \`shared.<table>\` is ONE table that every
  user of this app sees.
- **Default to \`mine.\`. Reach for \`shared.\` only when the app is deliberately
  about EVERYONE**, and you could say so out loud: a company-wide directory, a
  team leaderboard, a catalog. If the ask does not say, it is \`mine.\` — the two
  mistakes are not the same size. A list that should have been shared is a
  private list, and someone asks for it to be shared. A list that should have
  been private is everyone reading everyone else's data, and nobody finds out
  until they do. "Keep a tracker of…", "my…", "our regulars…" spoken by one
  person about their own work: \`mine.\`.
- A bare table name is refused.
- **Make the table first, from YOUR OWN tool call, before you save a screen that
  reads it.** The checks run the screen's queries for real, so a screen reading a
  table nobody has made yet fails on the way to the person:
  \`tools.vendo_apps_sql({ appId: "<the app's id>", sql: "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mine.pets (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, born TEXT)" })\`.
- **Read on first paint with \`useQuery\`**, like any other read — and leave
  \`appId\` OUT, because the screen already knows which app it is:
  \`const pets = useQuery("vendo_apps_sql", { sql: "SELECT * FROM mine.pets" })\`.
  That input is LITERAL, written out in the file. It answers
  \`{ columns, rows, rowCount }\` — the tool's own fields, on the hook's result, as
  every read here does — so the rows are \`pets.rows ?? []\`. Not \`pets.data.rows\`:
  \`data\` is a field some tools happen to answer with, never a wrapper this one
  has, and a screen that reads it gets \`undefined\` on every row it ever loads.
- **Write from a handler**, never during render:
  \`tools.vendo_apps_sql({ sql: "INSERT INTO mine.pets (id, name, born) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", params: [id, name, born] })\`.
  Every \`useQuery\` re-runs after it, so never patch state to mirror the write.
- **Every value goes in \`params\`, with \`?\` where it belongs in the statement.**
  Never paste a person's text into the SQL itself — an apostrophe alone breaks it.
- One statement per call. SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER
  TABLE, DROP TABLE.
- Prefer SQL that reads the same on SQLite and Postgres — \`TEXT\`, \`INTEGER\`,
  \`REAL\`, \`PRIMARY KEY\`, ordinary joins. An app can move between the two, and
  the plain subset travels where a vendor-specific type or function does not.

## State — \`useState\`

- State is for what the screen is doing NOW — what is typed, what is open, what
  is selected. What the person expects to KEEP goes in the database above, not
  here: a \`useState\` seeded from a hardcoded array is an app that forgets.
- Inputs are controlled: \`value={x}\` with \`onChange={(e) => setX(e.target.value)}\`,
  and \`value\` must read STATE you set in that same handler. A \`value\` taken off
  query data — \`value={row.status}\` — with no \`setX\` behind it snaps back to the
  old value the instant they pick something: the tool call goes out and the screen
  shows nothing happened. Where the choice IS the action and you hold no state for
  it, leave \`value\` off.
- A handler receives a plain \`{ target: { value } }\` — a checkbox or a switch,
  \`{ target: { checked } }\`.
- Two controls put something other than a string in \`value\`, and the state they
  set has to match, so convert it in the handler:
  - \`<Slider>\` gives a number — \`onChange={(e) => setPoints(Number(e.target.value))}\`.
  - \`<Select multiple>\` gives the whole selection —
    \`onChange={(e) => setPicked([...e.target.value])}\`, over \`useState([])\`.
- There is no \`preventDefault\` to call: \`<Form>\` submits itself.

## Worked screens

The ask: "let me cancel a transfer before it goes out."

\`\`\`tsx
import { Button, Card, Row, Stack, Text, tools, useQuery } from "@vendo/screen";

const money = (cents) => (cents / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", { style: "currency", currency: "USD" });
const day = (iso) => new Date(iso).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short", day: "numeric", year: "numeric" });

export default function PendingTransfers() {
  const pending = useQuery("list_pending_transfers");

  return (
    <Stack gap={12}>
      <Text text="Transfers waiting to go out" variant="heading" />

      {pending.data.length === 0 ? (
        <Text text="Nothing is waiting to go out." variant="caption" />
      ) : (
        pending.data.map((transfer) => (
          <Card key={transfer.id} title={transfer.recipient}>
            <Row justify="between" align="center">
              <Stack gap={4}>
                <Text text={money(transfer.amount_cents)} />
                <Text text={day(transfer.scheduled_for)} variant="caption" />
              </Stack>
              <Button label="Cancel" tone="danger" onClick={() => tools.cancel_transfer({ id: transfer.id })} />
            </Row>
          </Card>
        ))
      )}
    </Stack>
  );
}
\`\`\`

The ask: "what do I owe this month, and let me pay it all at once." A total the ask
names is COMPUTED off the rows the screen drew, and said again in the dialog that
acts on it.

\`\`\`tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button, DataTable, Modal, Row, Stack, Stat, Text, tools, useQuery } from "@vendo/screen";

const money = (cents) => (cents / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", { style: "currency", currency: "USD" });
const day = (iso) => new Date(iso).toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short", day: "numeric" });

export default function BillsDue() {
  const bills = useQuery("list_open_bills");
  const [confirming, setConfirming] = useState(false);
  const totalCents = bills.data.reduce((sum, bill) => sum + bill.amount_cents, 0);

  return (
    <Stack gap={12}>
      <Row justify="between" align="center">
        <Stat label="Due this month" value={money(totalCents)} />
        <Button label="Pay all" onClick={() => setConfirming(true)} />
      </Row>
      <DataTable rows={bills.data} columns={["payee", { key: "due_on", label: "Due", cell: (bill) => <Text text={day(bill.due_on)} /> }, { key: "amount_cents", label: "Amount", align: "end", cell: (bill) => <Text text={money(bill.amount_cents)} /> }]} />
      <Modal open={confirming} onClose={() => setConfirming(false)} title="Pay every open bill?"
        footer={<Button label="Pay all" onClick={() => { for (const bill of bills.data) tools.pay_bill({ id: bill.id }); setConfirming(false); }} />}>
        <Text>This pays {bills.data.length} bills, {money(totalCents)} in total.</Text>
      </Modal>
    </Stack>
  );
}
\`\`\`

The ask: "compare the plans side by side." An ask that names the things to compare
gets a fixed \`columns\` — \`minChildWidth\` is for tiles whose count the data decides.

\`\`\`tsx
import { Button, Card, Grid, KeyValue, Stack, Text, tools, useQuery } from "@vendo/screen";

const money = (cents) => (cents / 100).toLocaleString("en-US", { style: "currency", currency: "USD" });

export default function ComparePlans() {
  const plans = useQuery("list_plans");

  return (
    <Stack gap={12}>
      <Text text="Every plan, side by side" variant="heading" />
      <Grid columns={3} gap={8}>
        {plans.data.map((plan) => (
          <Card key={plan.id} title={plan.name}>
            <Stack gap={6}>
              <Text text={money(plan.price_cents)} variant="heading" />
              <KeyValue record={plan} items={[{ key: "seats", label: "Seats" }, { key: "support", label: "Support" }]} />
              <Button label="Switch" onClick={() => tools.switch_plan({ id: plan.id })} />
            </Stack>
          </Card>
        ))}
      </Grid>
    </Stack>
  );
}
\`\`\`

The ask: "let me work through the open tickets one at a time." Three habits: the
selection starts on the FIRST row, never on nothing; the row action is on EVERY row,
and \`disabled\` only where THAT ROW has nothing to do (a ticket already closed), with
the reason on it; and the filter's choices are read
off the data rather than typed out, so they cannot disagree with it.

\`\`\`tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button, DataTable, KeyValue, Row, Select, SplitPane, Stack, Tooltip, tools, useQuery } from "@vendo/screen";

export default function Tickets() {
  const tickets = useQuery("list_tickets");
  const rows = tickets.data;
  const [openId, setOpenId] = useState(rows[0]?.id);
  const [category, setCategory] = useState("");
  const shown = category === "" ? rows : rows.filter((row) => row.category === category);

  return (
    <SplitPane size="45%">
      <Stack gap={8}>
        <Select label="Category" placeholder="All categories" value={category}
          options={[...new Set(rows.map((row) => row.category))]}
          onChange={(e) => setCategory(e.target.value)} />
        <DataTable rows={shown} columns={["subject", "status"]} rowActions={(row) => (
          <Row gap={6}>
            <Button label="Open" disabled={row.id === openId} onClick={() => setOpenId(row.id)} />
            <Tooltip label={row.status === "closed" ? "Already closed" : "Close this ticket"}>
              {/* openId is sibling state to this press — read it with prev, never the render's copy. */}
              <Button label="Close" tone="danger" disabled={row.status === "closed"} onClick={() => { tools.close_ticket({ id: row.id }); setOpenId((prev) => (prev === row.id ? rows.find((other) => other.id !== row.id)?.id : prev)); }} />
            </Tooltip>
          </Row>
        )} />
      </Stack>
      <KeyValue record={rows.find((row) => row.id === openId)} items={["subject", "category", "assignee", "status"]} />
    </SplitPane>
  );
}
