/**
 * `AppsRuntime.seed` — the ✦ fork, starting from the splitter's ported source.
 *
 * A remix is not a subsystem. It is a `create` that starts from something that
 * already existed, so this module is thin on purpose: it finds the captured
 * baseline, SEEDS that baseline's ported source as the new app's own `app.tsx`,
 * records what the person asked for, and hands the ordinary edit door the
 * instruction. Standard validation, standard edit path, standard history.
 *
 * THE PORT IS THE POINT. A fork whose first edit starts from an empty file is not
 * a fork of anything — it is a fresh generation wearing the component's name. So
 * the ported source lands FIRST, through the ordinary checks floor, and the
 * person's wishes are then edits OF THE COMPONENT'S REAL CODE. Fork plus first
 * edit are still ONE operation, and its output is still a regular screen
 * (`app.tsx`, through the ordinary edit door). The captured baseline is
 * provenance: what the remix started from, and what a re-seed replays the
 * recorded wishes against.
 *
 * A baseline with no `ported` half was not provably splittable. It gets NO remix
 * and, upstream of here, no ✦ at all: the chrome offers the gesture only on the
 * slots the generated wiring names. A direct call is refused at the lookup,
 * before anything is minted — never a fallback that regenerates the component
 * from scratch.

 * The COURIER: record the live props of the host instance this remix stands in

 *

 * checks floor paints the port on the baseline's captured `sampleProps` — the
 * values frozen the day `vendo sync` ran — and the remix shows that number
 * forever while the host's own component beside it shows today's.
 *
 * This is PROVENANCE, not content. It writes `seed.props` and touches nothing
 * else: no version is minted, no wish is recorded and no edit door is entered,
 * because the person did not change their remix — their page did. That is also
 * why it is safe to call on every render the props really change on.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY is the captured baseline's own declared prop names. The wrapper
 * ships whatever the host's call site passed, so a value the component never
 * declared — anything the page happened to hang on that element — is dropped
 * HERE, before it is stored, rather than being filtered at each of the places
 * that later read the seed. A baseline that captured no props declares none and
 * so admits none: never invented, exactly like the paint it feeds.
 *
 * READ AND WRITE TAKE A TURN ON THE ROW (`onAppRow`). Being provenance rather
 * than an edit is exactly what makes this dangerous: it writes whenever the host
 * re-renders, including all the way through a ✦ mint's build, and a save cannot
 * tell this write from an edit that would revert it — so landing inside one's
 * window refused it as `app changed under this save`, one mint in three.
