/**
 * The builder's validate gate — blueprint §7.1 item 4, "validate-must-pass before
 * done".
 *
 * Nothing tested this because nothing did it: the `validate` verb was registered,
 * the building-apps skill told the model to call it, and whether it ever did was
 * the model's business. A builder that skipped it reported success over a broken
 * app, and the only thing that noticed was the paint seam refusing to paint —
 * silently, from the model's point of view.
 *
 * The gate calls the SAME registered verb through `turn.tools.call`, so it goes
 * through one guard, one audit row and one mirror like every other call. There is
 * no second validate.
