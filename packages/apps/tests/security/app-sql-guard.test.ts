/**
 * The door, attacked.

 * Generated SQL is hostile input, and the ONLY thing standing between one
 * person's rows and another's is that no statement can name a physical table.
 * Every case here is an attempt to name one anyway — through a schema, through
 * a second statement, through a quoted identifier, through the catalog, through
 * a rename — and the bar is that each is REFUSED, not merely unlikely to work.
 *
 * The companion to this file is app-sql-postgres.test.ts, which runs the same
 * boundary against a REAL Postgres. This one proves the refusals; that one
 * proves the rows.
