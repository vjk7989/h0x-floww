/**
 * The subsumption proof: for every bespoke static check tsc is meant to
 * replace, the SAME defect goes through the bespoke check and through
 * {@link screenTscFindings}, and both must report. This is the evidence that
 * lets the bespoke check be deleted — nothing else is.
 *
 * The two halves read the two artifacts they really read. The bespoke walkers
 * take a `Tree` — a stored document's own tree, with `$path` bindings still in
 * it — so the fixtures below build one directly; the wire compiler that used to
 * make one out of markup is gone, and a component screen's RENDERED tree carries
 * values where these walkers look for bindings. The tsc half reads the `app.tsx`
 * source that says the same thing, through the same typings and lib the floor's
 * `screen-types` check uses. Two artifacts, one defect, two checkers, no stub on
 * either side.
 *
 * Gaps are asserted too — the cases where the compiler CANNOT see what the
 * bespoke check sees are pinned by a test that expects silence, so a gap can
 * never be quietly reclassified as coverage.
