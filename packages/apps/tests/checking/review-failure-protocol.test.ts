/**
 * The review FAILURE protocol — architecture design §7, evaluation E4.
 *
 * §7 promises: "FAIL → the commit lands as a flagged version (the previous
 * version keeps serving), one bounded fix round, then a plain-language card on the
 * app ('Your change didn't pass a safety check: <reason>. Fix it / keep the
 * current version'). An `owner` may accept a flagged version, with the override
 * recorded in the audit trail — except host-check failures, which only the host
 * can waive via its own policy config."
 *
 * NONE OF THAT EXISTS. Every test below is `.skip`, deliberately: the lane that
 * wrote this file was asked to find out whether the protocol was real, and a
 * false claim reported as false is the deliverable — not a subsystem built to
 * make the sentence true. Each test names exactly what must be built first.
 *
 * WHAT THE CODE DOES TODAY, with the evidence:
 *
 *  1. A blocking finding DOES now stop the write (2026-08-01, `./commit-gate.test.ts`).
 *     `runtime.ts` refuses at the commit path on both paths: `create()` fails the
 *     build before it emits or persists, and `edit()` returns `failedEdit(...)`
 *     before `persistEdit(...)` ever runs, so the previous app stays in its row
 *     and keeps serving. That is the FAIL half of §7 — but it is a REFUSAL, not
 *     the flagged-version protocol the rest of this file describes: what §7 asks
 *     for beyond it (a landed-but-flagged commit, a post-land fix round, a card
 *     with two choices, an owner override) is still absent, and the tests below
 *     still name it.
 *  2. There is no version status to be flagged. `AppDocument`
 *     (`packages/core/src/app-document.ts`) has no `status`/`flagged`/`review`
 *     field — the only failure-ish field is `buildFailed`, a terminal generation
 *     crash marker. `appRecordInput` (`../persistence.ts`) keys the row by the app
 *     id, so every write clobbers the live row. `createAppHistory`
 *     (`../history.ts`) archives the PREVIOUS doc, but serving always reads the
 *     single live row: there is no served-version pointer distinct from the
 *     latest-written one, so "the previous version keeps serving" has no
 *     mechanism.
 *  3. The bounded fix round exists but at the wrong time. The claude-code
 *     harness runs ONE validate-and-repair round at the turn boundary
 *     (`@vendoai/harnesses` `claude-code/index.ts`, `repairInstruction`) — a
 *     PRE-land loop, and whatever survives it lands unflagged.
 *  4. Check PROVENANCE now exists (2026-08-05, `./checking.test.ts`). `Finding`
 *     carries `check`, stamped by `./layer.ts` — the one place that knows the
 *     answer for every check at once — and overriding whatever the check itself
 *     wrote there, since a check is untrusted code. So a host-check failure IS
 *     identifiable now, and §7's carve-out is representable. What is still absent
 *     is everything the carve-out would be applied AT: there is no accept-flagged
 *     path and no override to refuse. One caveat remains inside the reviewer: a
 *     host JUDGMENT RULE is still folded into the reviewer's single rubric, so it
 *     comes back stamped `reviewer` rather than as the host's own — a plugged
 *     `Pack.checks` entry is distinguishable, a plugged rubric line is not.
 *
 * The floor itself is real and good — the reviewer, the pack checks, the judgment
 * rubric and the pre-land repair round all work, a `block` now stops the write, and since
 * 2026-08-05 the floor runs at the PAINT SEAM for every author (blueprint §7.1),
 * so a `block` also means the view never reaches the user. It is the protocol
 * AFTER a FAIL — the flagged version, its remediation round, its card and its
 * override — that is absent.
