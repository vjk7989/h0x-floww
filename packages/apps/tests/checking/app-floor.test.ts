/**
 * `createAppFloor` — the checks floor as the PAINT SEAM calls it (blueprint §7.1).
 *
 * The hole this closes is worth restating, because it is what these tests are
 * for: the seam used to read the hot-path file itself and decide what to paint,
 * so a harness's own writes faced a different gate than the conductor's — a lying
 * read painted, and nothing at the seam ever RAN the screen. The floor was live
 * for the conductor and structurally dead for every other author, and every test
 * passed the whole time, because nothing ever asked the floor to render anything.
 *
 * One method now: `component`. So these drive it through its real entry point, on
 * real `app.tsx`, and assert what a structurally-dead floor cannot do — execute a
 * screen's query, refuse a read the tool's response does not carry, fire the
 * host's own checks over what was rendered, and hand the row half both halves of
 * its answer.
