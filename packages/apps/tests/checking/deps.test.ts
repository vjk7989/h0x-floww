/**
 * The floor's independence, as a guard rather than a promise.
 *
 * Blueprint §7.3 — the checking floor and the generation pipeline were mutually
 * entangled (`facts.ts` imported `GenerationDependencies` from
 * `generation/engine.js`, the reviewer imported the pipeline's prompt and its
 * strict-tool-call helper), so the conductor could not be quarantined without
 * taking the floor down with it. The floor now owns its own dependency type, and
 * this test is what keeps it that way: a floor that reaches back into the
 * pipeline is a floor that dies with the pipeline.
