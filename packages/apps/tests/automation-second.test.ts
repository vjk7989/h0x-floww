/**
 * A SECOND automation on an app that already has one.
 *
 * "Add an alert to my dashboard just adds an entry" is the design's flagship
 * sentence — but every plan the authoring path produced landed on the one entry
 * the app already had, so the second automation an app was ever asked for
 * silently REPLACED the first. The
 * embedded agent, reading its own result back, answered "I can't set two
 * separate schedules on the same app". An automation is its own record now, and
 * an app names a LIST of them — but the same lazy plan still has to be refused.
 *
 * This rides the real runtime through the public automation door: real store
 * row, real plan → lane → persist, and the automations seam. Only the model and
 * the engine behind the seam are stubbed — the model cannot be run here, and the
 * engine is another block this one may not import.
 *
 * The host below composes NO sandbox and no machine flags, and both automations
 * are agentic — so this is also the door's own law: authoring an automation
 * never needed a machine, and it authors and arms with none anywhere.
