/**
 * The front door's routing seam — blueprint §1 point 2 and §4.5.
 *
 * `vendo_make` starts every request in the screen agent, and the answer it gets
 * back is the answer the person gets. `escalate` is a request for the builder,
 * and what it gets depends on one thing — whether this deployment has a sandbox
 * to build in. Everything else is assembly coming back empty, which is now the
 * end of the ask rather than a quiet hand-off to a second engine. Three
 * properties make that safe rather than merely intended:
 *
 * 1. **One app id, whichever way an escalation lands.** The screen agent was
 *    handed an id and the person is already watching that stream. A build that
 *    minted its own id would paint the finished app onto a SECOND stream and
 *    leave the first as a card that builds forever; a failure reported against a
 *    different id would leave the same orphan.
 * 2. **A deployment that cannot build says so, BEFORE it spends anything.** No
 *    builder means nowhere to build, so the receipt fails honestly rather than
 *    asking and reporting it late. Nothing re-plans the ask on the
 *    way either: the person's own words and the escalation's one-line `why` are
 *    the whole brief the build gets.
 * 3. **An unwired or unserving assembler surfaces LOUDLY.** Composition forgetting
 *    the slot, an assembler that threw, an `unavailable`, and an `assembled` that
 *    left no row are four different bugs and four failed receipts — never a
 *    "ready" served by an engine nobody chose.
