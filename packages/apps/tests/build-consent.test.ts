/**
 * S3 — consent. "No machine is ever spent without the user's explicit yes."

 * Three things are pinned here, and the middle one is the slice's SEAM: the

 * consent side is the real path — the real `vendo_make` front door, the real
 * propose door, the real parked-build collection over a real engine, the real
 * `onApprovalDecision` subscription, and the real app row. Only the two ends
 * are stand-ins, and both by design: the SCREEN agent (whose escalation is the
 * input) and the `AppBuilder` (whose lane is S4's).
