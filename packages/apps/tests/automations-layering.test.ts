/**
 * The layering flip, and the ONE create operation under it.
 *
 * Two invariants live here, and both are about what an automation is NOT.
 *
 * 1. There is exactly one underlying create-automation operation. Every
 *    authoring door this package owns reaches `AutomationsSeam.create` and
 *    nothing else — `vendo_automate`, the chat lane behind
 *    `runtime.automation.author` (which is where `vendo_make`'s compound half
 *    enters, at `make-tool.ts`'s single `runtime.automation` call), and the
 *    reschedule door. A door that grew a create
 *    path of its own would still report a record, so the census below is over
 *    `creates`: a record can only exist by passing through the one operation,
 *    which makes that list the whole proof.
 *
 * 2. An automation carries no app reference of any kind. The pointer runs the
 *    other way — an app names a LIST of ids — and it is a list of names, not a
 *    foreign key: dead ids drop out on read, and deleting the APP leaves the
 *    automation firing and failing LOUDLY at tool resolution. That last one is
 *    the designed behavior, not a thing to guard against, so it is asserted
 *    here rather than defended against in the code.
 *
 * The engine behind the seam is a double because it has to be: `@vendoai/apps`
 * may import `@vendoai/core` and nothing else, so the seam IS the block
 * boundary. Everything on THIS side of it is real — the real tool registry, the
 * real store, the real access check, the real lane — and the double fakes
 * storage only, never policy: `toTriggerSource` is core's own and
 * `reconcileAutomations` is never stubbed at all. The two sides meeting for real
 * is the e2e fixtures' job.
