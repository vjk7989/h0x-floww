/**
 * The memory door's caps, through the REAL door and the REAL store.
 *
 * The caps live at the write site rather than in the schema so a stored row
 * survives a cap that changes — which means the only place they can be proved is
 * a write followed by a read. Nothing here is stubbed: `createApps` over a real
 * store, `runtime.remember` as the one writer, `runtime.get` as the reader.
