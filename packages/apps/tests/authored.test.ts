 * Build contract §1.6 / redesign D4 — a FILES-FIRST app is a first-class app.
 *
 * The live E2E defect this closes (2026-08-03): the claude-code harness wrote the
 * app's screen with its own hands, the render seam painted it, and nothing else
 * ever happened — no store row, so the app was absent from the person's list and
 * `vendo_apps_open` masked it as `not-found`, and no query ever ran, so every
 * value on screen read "—" while the host data sat one call away.
 *
 * The checks floor's paint gate is the one door that closes both halves — its own
 * `ok` is what calls `AppsRuntime.authoredScreen` — and these are its rules: the
 * row lands through the SAME writer generation persists with, the queries run
 * through the SAME guard-bound caller `open()` resolves with (so a query the
 * policy gates paints nothing at all, exactly like an app's own read), and an app
 * that already exists keeps everything that is its own history.
