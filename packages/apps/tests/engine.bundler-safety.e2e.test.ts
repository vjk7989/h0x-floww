/**
 * The TSX toolchain (checking/toolchain.ts) lazy-loads
 * esbuild (a native-binary package). A bundler (webpack, or Next's Turbopack) that
 * sees a literal `import("esbuild")` in a module it's bundling walks INTO
 * esbuild's own package to build its module graph — regardless of whether
 * the import ever executes — and esbuild's lib/main.js resolves its native
 * binary with its own dynamic require, which a bundler cannot statically
 * follow. The bundler then tries to parse the platform binary and its
 * README.md as JS modules and hard-fails the build ("Unknown module type",
 * "invalid utf-8 sequence"). Every Next host importing
 * "@vendoai/vendo/server" reaches this file transitively through
 * @vendoai/apps, so this broke EVERY host build, masked only by the demo
 * apps' own `next.config` carrying `serverExternalPackages: ["esbuild"]`.
 *
 * Fix: `webpackIgnore`/`turbopackIgnore` magic comments on the import() call
 * tell the bundler to skip resolving this specific specifier entirely,
 * instead of walking into esbuild's package. Node ignores magic comments —
 * this stays a plain dynamic import at runtime, so it still works under
 * Vitest's vm-sandboxed test runner (a `new Function`-built indirection was
 * tried first and rejected: it hides the specifier from the bundler too, but
 * throws ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING under Vitest, breaking the
 * existing engine tests).
 *
 * This test builds the package's real dist output (tsc, same command
 * `pnpm build` runs) and inspects it directly — proving what a consumer
 * actually imports, not just the source a human edits.
