/**
 * Build contract §1.6, the hot-path render seam: every store write to the
 * hot-path file (`app.tsx`) that PAINTS makes the runtime emit today's
 * `data-vendo-view` part — same payload, same stable per-app stream id. A write
 * the checks floor refuses emits NOTHING and the last good view stays on screen.
 * Harnesses never yield view events; only this seam emits them.
 *
 * The store-write moment is `commit()`, not `writeFile` (orchestrator seam answer
 * after lane B landed): the façade stages writes in memory and
 * `CommitResult.changed` names exactly what reached the store. So every case here
 * writes AND commits, which is what the runtime makes happen for the harness.
 *
 * The floor is the REAL floor (`createAppFloor` — real esbuild, real tsc, the
 * real sealed VM), because the seam paints through `options.floor.component()`
 * and nothing else: a stubbed gauntlet here would be a seam agreeing with itself.
