### Minor Changes

- 5e956c5: **One SQL database per app, and the app-data family is deleted.**

  A generated app now keeps its data in a real SQL database of its own, reached
  through one agent tool — `vendo_apps_sql`, which runs one statement and whose
  description states the live dialect. Two table namespaces are the entire
  permission model: `shared.<table>` is one table every user of the app shares,
  and `mine.<table>` is per-user. A bare table name is refused with what
  happened, why, and the fix.

  `mine.` is enforced at the DOOR and never by generated SQL: `mine.x` becomes a
  physical table of that person's own, named with a character no identifier the
  grammar admits can contain, so one person's tables have no spelling in
  another's SQL. Every statement runs with `search_path` set to the app's own
  schema, so a name that arrives unqualified resolves inside the app or nowhere.
  Ordinary SQL keeps ordinary meaning — a `PRIMARY KEY` is unique per person, a
  `UNIQUE` is per person, and a join is a join.

  New adapter slot `createVendo({ appDatabase })`, standard adapter rule: an
  explicitly passed adapter always wins. Unset, every app gets its own fenced
  schema inside the Postgres the host already wired — ZERO new configuration. A
  store with no SQL handle composes no adapter and the tool is not offered.

  **Deleted, whole:** the `vendo_apps_data_list` / `_put` / `_delete` tools, the
  `storage` declaration on `AppDocument` (`StorageDecl`) and its allow-list gate,
  `StoreOps["appData"]` and `AppDataTarget`, the `app:<id>:<collection>` record
  and blob namespaces, the 256 KB record and 5 MB file caps, and the app-data
  owner backfill. Migration is fix-forward: chat-built apps could never save
  through the old path, and its blob half had no callers. The `appData.*` wire
  paths keep their RETIRED slots so the `/status` op levels still point at the
  ops they always pointed at; nothing serves them and they answer 501.

  Three isolation hazards die with that path: the unowned façade that gave every
  user one shared drawer on a store with no ops surface, `hostedStore`'s
  `owner: "user_local"` default that put a whole multi-user deployment in one
  drawer, and the un-allowlisted `ops.blobs` namespace that let a caller write
  into another owner's app files.

### Patch Changes

- 5e956c5: **The app SQL guard's reserved names now bind an identifier, not a spelling of
  one.**

  The deny rules ran in the bare-identifier branch alone, so every reserved family
  was admitted behind two quote characters: `query_to_xml` was refused and
  `"query_to_xml"` ran. That function is `PUBLIC`-executable, takes a whole SQL
  string and runs it as whoever the connection is — the host's own store role —
  and `search_path` cannot fence it, because `pg_catalog` is always implicitly
  searched. Every catalog name the guard knows about was reachable the same way,
  which defeated the `mine.`/`shared.` boundary outright.

  Quoted, unquoted, mixed case, partially quoted and `pg_catalog.`-prefixed now
  refuse alike, and the refusal names the family rather than the grammar. The
  quoted identifiers an app legitimately writes are untouched: a column named
  `"order"`, a quoted alias, and a table name it wants case-folded all still run.

### Minor Changes

- 5a62c19: `VENDO_CONSOLE_URL` names our origin; `VENDO_BASE_URL` names yours.

  Vendo shipped four look-alike "a URL" environment variables, two of which landed
  in the same generated code block on the edge-runtimes page:

  ```ts
  const apiKey = env.VENDO_API_KEY;
  const baseUrl = (env.VENDO_CLOUD_URL ?? "https://console.vendo.run").replace(
    /\/+$/,
    ""
  );
  ```

  `VENDO_BASE_URL` is the host app's own public URL. `VENDO_CLOUD_URL` read like
  "the URL of my cloud deployment" — which is exactly what it is not. Point it at
  your app and every Cloud adapter quietly calls your app instead of the console.

  `VENDO_CLOUD_URL` is now `VENDO_CONSOLE_URL`. Nothing breaks: the old name is
  still read, the new one wins when both are set, and the first read of the old one
  logs a single line naming the new one. The generated Workers/Bun/Deno scaffold
  spells the value `consoleUrl` rather than `baseUrl`, so the two URLs no longer
  look alike where they sit side by side.

  `VENDO_URL` is retired. It overrode the wire URL `vendo sync` probes — a job
  `vendo sync --url` already does per run, and one `VENDO_BASE_URL` already derives.
  It is still read, and `vendo sync` says so once when it is.

  `VENDO_BASE_URL` and `VENDO_HOST_API_URL` are unchanged. Renaming either would
  churn every deployment for no gain: one is the most-typed variable Vendo has, the
  other already says what it is.

  `@vendoai/core` exports `consoleUrlFromEnv(env?)`, the single reader every block
  now shares instead of six copies of `process.env["VENDO_CLOUD_URL"]`. Two of
  those copies took a blank value literally and passed `baseUrl: ""` down to the
  adapter; every reader now treats blank as unset, the way the umbrella always did.

- 60d1f58: `import theme from ".vendo/theme.json"` now assigns to `<VendoProvider theme>`
  with no cast. Every quickstart paste used to carry `as VendoTheme` plus an
  `import type { VendoTheme }` line beside it, because a bundler widens a JSON
  module's string literals and `density`, `motion` and `typography.fonts[].source`
  were exact literal unions. Those three fields now carry a `| (string & {})` arm,
  so plain `string` assigns.

  Autocomplete is unchanged: `"compact"`/`"comfortable"`, `"full"`/`"reduced"` and
  `"next/font"`/`"public"`/`"google"` are still the values an editor offers.

  On-disk validation is unchanged: `vendoThemeSchema` still parses the file
  strictly, so a machine-written `theme.json` with a bad adjective still fails to
  parse. The CSS mapping normalizes too — an unknown `density` renders as
  `comfortable` and an unknown `motion` as `full`, adjective variable included,
  rather than emitting a value nothing can read.

  `vendo init`'s printed client hint drops the cast and the type import, so the
  TypeScript paste is now the same paste JavaScript hosts get.

### Patch Changes

- 66f6165: A build that runs out of time says so, instead of blaming capacity.

  A box gives one turn a fixed message budget, and a turn that outruns it throws
  `unavailable` — the same code a genuinely busy service answers with. The
  classifier that turns a build throw into the sentence on the person's failure
  card read that code and nothing else, so it answered "busy, try again shortly"
  for both.

  For a busy service that sentence is true and useful. For a budget it is two
  lies: the failure is not capacity, and waiting cannot help — a budget expires on
  schedule, so the next attempt spends the whole window and dies at the same
  mark. It also invites the retry it cannot survive; four escalated builds in a
  row were reported this way, each dying at 15.2–15.4 minutes against a 15-minute
  budget, on asks as small as "show a QR code".

  Budget exhaustion is now told apart from capacity by the sentence the box throws
  with it, and reported as "the build ran out of its time budget", non-retryable.
  The number stays out of it: the bound is internal and a person cannot act on it.

- a1e965c: fix: the build consent card says what a build actually does. Ruling 14 keeps a descriptor's description off the consent ladder, so the authored build sentence never reached the card and a person approving a build machine read the generic "This changes something in your account, and it runs as you." The copy Vendo writes by hand for its own tools now lives beside `VENDO_TOOL_TITLES` as `VENDO_TOOL_NOTES`, which the ladder reads under the host's own `ToolMeta.description` — so the card and the words-only surfaces (`BUILD_CONSENT_ASK`) say one thing, and nothing extracted can reach that rung.
- ebda436: A `vendo_make` EDIT hands back the builder's own words, not the app's name.

  The create arm has relayed the assembling agent's closing sentence since the
  front door stopped composing one out of the app's title. The edit arm never did:
  every landed change answered `"<name> is updated."` and every refused one
  `"I couldn't make that change to <name>."` — a title and no facts. The floor's
  own reason for the refusal was already computed and carried as far as
  `EditResult.issues`, then dropped at the door.

  Handed a title and no facts, a calling agent invents the rest. Across six
  consecutive runs on a demo host, a chat agent told the person a per-client
  document tracker was "still intact" over a stage-by-assignee table it had never
  seen, and reported features that were never on the screen.

  `ScreenOutcome.say` now travels the edit path the same way it travels the create
  path, and a refused edit says why in the floor's own sentences.

- 2cf7b3d: fix: bump esbuild to ^0.28.2 so the Go-compiled binary this package lazy-loads for screen checks carries a crypto/tls past CVE-2025-68121 (esbuild 0.25.12 was built with the EOL go1.23.12; 0.28.2 ships go1.26.5)
- 20738bc: Stop a component screen's prop refusal from contradicting itself. When the value bound to a Kit prop differed from the prop's own type in one nested field — a `columns` array hoisted out of the JSX, so `align: "end"` widened to `string` before the enum saw it — the long-type summarizer collapsed BOTH sides to the same words and the screen agent was handed `prop "columns" on <DataTable> takes a list of rows, but this value is a list of rows`. A refusal that contradicts itself names no repair, so the agent retried forever, never painted, never errored and never escalated. Where the two summaries come out identical the check now falls through to the compiler's own nested sentence, which names the field that disagrees and the values it will take.

- 52f5b64: A conversation's harness state lives on the conversation, and `vendo_state` is gone

  The bookmark a session-owning harness resumes on — `claudeCode()`'s native session
  ref — rode `vendo_state` under a synthetic `app_id` of `harness_state:<threadId>`.
  That bought "no new table" and paid for it everywhere else: thread deletion swept
  the slot by hand in two places, a retention sweep needed a fence to stop the
  app-state door from seeing a tenant it could not address, the erase cascade reached
  it only through a second selector, and a routed door had to police an id grammar
  whose whole job was keeping the two tenants off each other's rows.

  It is one nullable `harness_state jsonb` column on `vendo_threads` now. ONE slot per
  thread, on the row that already names the thread's owner — so every one of those
  hand-wired cascades is just the row going away. The two `DELETE` statements, the
  retention fence, the tenant carve-out and its `<appId>:<subject>` grammar, the
  `validateId` hook nothing else used, and `harnessStateKey` are all deleted rather
  than adapted.

  `vendo_state`'s other tenant — an app's per-user state — is deleted with it. Nothing
  had written it since the `appData` family took over: `getState`/`setState` on
  `AppDataAccess` had no production caller at all, and the `$state` persistence bridge
  in `@vendoai/ui` (`onStateChange`) was never wired to anything. The `$state` screen
  dialect itself is untouched and still resolves in-session; only the never-connected
  persistence half is gone. The reserved-name guards that refuse a storage collection
  or a query named `state` stay exactly as they were.

  **Breaking — `StoreOps.harness` and the `/harness/*` wire.** The slot is keyed by the
  thread it belongs to, and now says so: `harness.get/set/clear(threadId, subject)`,
  with wire bodies `{threadId, subject}` on `/harness/get`, `/harness/set`,
  `/harness/clear` and on the `harness` part of `turn.load` and `turn.commit`.
  `subject` is the thread's OWNER and is authority rather than decoration — a foreign
  subject reads an empty slot and writes nothing, and `set` on a thread that does not
  exist is refused instead of minting a bookmark no erase could reach. A skewed client
  and mount fail CLOSED in both directions: `threadId` is required, so neither side can
  read the other's body as a slot it may serve, and each answers an enveloped
  `validation`. `/status`'s `ops` level is deliberately not touched — it is a monotone
  count that only grows as ops are added, and this adds and removes none.

  An app-scoped erase no longer clears harness state. That guarantee is dropped on
  purpose: a bookmark belongs to a conversation, and uninstalling an app ends no
  conversation. Thread deletion and subject erasure both still take it, and each is
  proven end to end against the real store.

  **Store schema v11 → v12.** `vendo_threads` gains `harness_state jsonb`. The
  migration copies every `harness_state:<threadId>` row onto its thread, matching on
  both legs of the old primary key — the id's thread suffix and the subject — then
  `DROP TABLE vendo_state`. A row whose subject disagreed with its thread's owner was
  unreachable by every read path and by the erase cascade already, so it dies with the
  table rather than being promoted onto a row it never belonged to. Guarded on the
  table's existence rather than on the version, in the v6 idiom, so it is idempotent
  and a no-op on a database created fresh. The v2 backfill is deleted along with it:
  it relocated legacy rows INTO this table, and there is nowhere left to put them.

  The engine allowlist goes to v11, having lost `vendo_state`.

- 92e9094: A select's value can reach a tool's enum, and a payload fault names the tool.

  A screen that fed a control's value into a tool whose input declares an ENUM had
  no state it was allowed to hold. Typed to the tool's own union it was refused at
  the handler, because the event a control hands a screen declared `value` as
  `string`; widened to `string` it was refused at the payload. Both arms refused
  correct intent, and the payload arm was stamped with the locus of the BUTTON the
  call sat under — `<Button> prop "onClick"` — so every repair looked like the
  handler and the model rewrote that handler for as long as it was allowed to.

  `value` on the change event is `any` now, which is what a control's data really
  is: a Slider reports a number and a multi-select an array, so the type it was
  given was never the type it had. And a value the compiler refuses INSIDE a tool
  payload is read as a payload fault wherever it files it — it names the tool and
  lists the keys the tool's input accepts, the same sentence a misspelled payload
  key already got.

- 79f177f: An escalated build asks on the standard consent protocol instead of answering
  as a success.

  `vendo_make` used to return a `status: "ok"` receipt reading
  `"awaiting-consent"` when the screen agent escalated to the builder, so the
  parked approval was invisible to everything that routes on the outcome: no
  in-thread approval card, and an outside agent over MCP was handed plain success
  for work nobody had authorized. It now returns the ordinary
  `pending-approval` outcome — which is what publishes the `data-vendo-approval`
  part the thread renders the card from, and what the MCP door maps to its
  approval-ref result.

  `ToolOutcome`'s `pending-approval` gains three optional fields for the tool that
  parks an ask of its OWN: `descriptor` (the ask's own — what a CARD derives its
  words from), `approval` (`{ id, question, notes }` — the same ask already in
  words, for a surface that renders no card) and `say` (the assistant's sentence
  meanwhile). All three are optional and additive; every shipped producer and
  reader is untouched.

  The descriptor rides the `data-vendo-approval` part, so the in-thread card is
  graded and worded off the BUILD. Graded off the calling tool it read
  `vendo_make`'s "read", and told a person that spending a build machine reads
  their data. And because a standing ask has no parked native call to render
  from — nor may it have one, since the runtime abandons every still-parked ask
  at the next turn — the thread now paints the shipped `ApprovalCard` from that
  part directly, deciding over the wire like the queue and the toast, with no
  `remember` disclosure. Before this the transcript showed only the calling
  tool's beat, "wasn't allowed", for a question nobody had been asked yet.

  Such a card also now SURVIVES the turn. A parked call is swept denied at turn
  end so a live-but-dead card cannot accrete in the queue — which, for a build,
  tombstoned the app the moment the turn that asked for it ended.

  An answered card SETTLES, and the assistant stops talking over it. In-thread
  consent cards resolve into the settled record on decide — including a decide the
  wire says was already answered (or swept), which used to leave the buttons live
  under an error on a closed question. And `say` is now the refusal the harness
  hands the model for a tool that parked its own ask, so the model relays the one
  sentence the door wrote ("I've asked for your go-ahead — the card above has the
  details.") instead of narrating its own paragraphs under a card that is already
  asking.

  `MakeReceipt.status` drops `"awaiting-consent"`; nothing produces it any more.

- 31c8e30: Files live where the work lives, and are really deleted when it is.

  A file dropped into chat used to go into one global drawer, live there forever,
  and belong to nothing. Now it belongs to the CONVERSATION: the upload lands in a
  staging area, and the turn that receives the message moves it to
  `/user/threads/<thread>/files/<name>` and rewrites the message before storing it,
  so the agent's shell finds it at a stable address and later turns on that thread
  still can. `/user/files` is now what its name always suggested — a keep-shelf for
  things the user asked you to save — and the three `vendo_user_files_*` tools say
  so, so the model stops shelving everything by reflex. Staged files that were never
  sent are swept by the next turn.

  Two real leaks close with it, both of which existed before this change:

  - Deleting a conversation deleted ONE row. Its messages stayed in
    `vendo_thread_messages` forever, unreachable by any later erasure because the
    join that identified them had gone with the row, and its harness state stayed
    with them. The delete now runs the cascade that already existed — thread row,
    messages and state in one transaction — and sweeps the conversation's files,
    including the blobs behind them.
  - Deleting an app never touched its workspace files or their objects. It now runs
    the store's own app cascade, which does.

  Nothing in the file model is harness-specific: a sandboxed harness materialises a
  conversation's files exactly as it materialises everything else, with no new code.

- 7bbfd3f: Built apps: the build lane. A consented build now runs the person's ask inside a disposable box — npm from the registry, the code written and tested in the box, the files sealed by the host — and the box is handed no store credentials at all. Approving a build card comes straight back instead of holding the request open for the whole build, and a reseal that fails keeps the app it was rebuilding. `@vendoai/harnesses` gains a `./claude-code/box` entry point carrying the box pool and the env/egress it boots with, so composition can reach them without the Agent SDK.
- 7bbfd3f: Close the mid-build window in the built-app sharing refusal. A row only declared itself a bundle when the build SEALED, so from the person's yes until the seal — minutes, and observed real builds ran 229–450 seconds — it carried neither signal `refuseBundleArtifact` reads, every one of the six refusal call sites let a share through, and the grant survived the seal into an app whose code then ran with the recipient's own permissions. The build now stamps `ui: "bundle"` when it STARTS rather than when it lands, so the row declares what it is becoming from the first moment a box can be spent and the refusal covers the whole window. Nothing else moves: the predicate is unchanged, the bundle route stays viewer-level, a failed first build still leaves the honest failure card, and normal screens — which carry `ui: "tree"` while their own build runs — stay shareable exactly as before.
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps: rendering a sealed bundle. An app whose artifact is a seal opens as `{kind:"bundle", entry}` and is served by the new `GET /apps/:id/bundle/:hash` — the sealed bytes inline in their own document, behind `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` as a real header, so the frame makes no network request at all. `@vendoai/ui` renders it in an iframe sandboxed `allow-scripts` with no `allow-same-origin`, which makes the app's origin opaque: brand tokens are posted in at render rather than baked into the seal, and host data reaches the app through one door only — a postMessage call that lands on the same guarded tool path a screen's press does, with the viewer's own permissions.
- 7bbfd3f: ask before spending a build machine: an ask the screen agent escalates now raises a standing approval card and `vendo_make` returns a receipt with the new status `awaiting-consent`, so the turn ends having claimed no sandbox. The person's yes — whenever it lands, possibly long after that turn is gone — is what starts the build: `AppsRuntime.build.propose` parks the ask against its approval (`vendo_parked_build`) and writes it onto the app row as a `proposal`, and the guard's decision alone runs the new `AppBuilder` seam and seals what it built. A no clears the proposal and leaves the honest failure card, with no box ever opened. `validateAppDocument` now refuses a document carrying both `proposal` and `building`
- 7bbfd3f: Retire the persistent per-app machine surface. A built app is now a sealed bundle the host serves, so nothing needs a machine that outlives the build: the `AppsRuntime.machine` lifecycle doors (`available`, `ping`, `report`), the §9.8 served-app proxy (`AppsRuntime.serve`, `GET /apps/:id/serve/**`), the editor-level box door (`AppsRuntime.box.request` / `.redact`, `POST /apps/:id/fn/:name`), the whole `/box/*` callback surface with its per-app bearer, and the embed keepalive (`POST /apps/:id/machine/ping`, `client.apps.pingMachine`) are all gone. The `ui` package loses `HttpFrame` and its keepalive wiring; `BundleFrame` and `bundleUrl` are what render an app now. `@vendoai/box-template` is deleted — the box image no longer bakes a per-app web template, and its harness keeps only the session half. `vendo_app_tokens` leaves the engine allowlist (v9), and the store's promote no longer re-owns a bearer that no longer exists. `packages/apps`' `prewired-schema` moves to `server/checking/`, beside the validator that reads it.
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps: five fixes found by a live proof against a real box. The build brief now sends the in-box agent to a real disk path, so the bundle it produces is where the host actually reads it — every build previously landed on "the build's own test did not pass" while a working bundle sat on the box. The build watchdog waits longer than the box's own message budget instead of killing real builds at four minutes. An app awaiting the person's yes now reads as pending rather than "This app can't be opened any more". A failed build keeps the app's name instead of renaming it to a cut of the prompt. And a propose that cannot finish takes its standing card back instead of leaving an ask with no build behind it. `@vendoai/harnesses` exports `BOX_WORKSPACE_ROOT` and `MESSAGE_BUDGET_MS`.
- 7bbfd3f: Retire the server lane and the machine stack it keystoned. Generation's
  `generation/lanes.ts` and the escalation box lane are gone, and with them the six
  modules they held up — the in-box agent (`box-agent`), egress approval, the `fn`
  runtime, the machine lifecycle, and the `vendo.json` manifest fold-in and its
  triggers — plus the box-lane secret redaction. `AppsConfig.machine`, `BoxRequest`
  and `BoxResponse` leave the runtime config, the served-app arms leave `open`,
  `write-surface`, `apps-surface`, `edit-journal` and `app-validation`, the create
  door's machine escalate path leaves `build-surface`, and the egress half leaves
  `approval-flow`. In core the app document's `ui` enum narrows to `"tree" |
"bundle"`, `machine` / `AppMachine` / `appMachineSchema` are gone, and the
  `vendo_egress_approval` row leaves the engine allowlist (v10). The composition
  loses the whole machine lane: the box inference door, the implicit egress domains
  and the `VENDO_BOX_EDIT_TIMEOUT_MS` / `VENDO_BOX_EDIT_POLL_MS` knobs that only fed
  it.
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps, last mile: a standing consent card a person can actually answer. An approval that was already waiting when the page loaded now raises its card on mount instead of only after — a build ask can outlive the tab that raised it, and the yes is meant to work whenever it lands, so an ask that only existed while you were watching was not a standing one. The card also says what it is asking: it reads the same plain-words ladder the approval card and its queue row read (the ask as a question, then every real input under it) rather than a bare tool label, it offers Deny beside Approve, and `vendo_app_build` joins the shared title table, so the consent moment reads "Build this app for real?" instead of "Vendo app build". Once the yes lands, the build's own status line reaches the person on that same surface — a detached build has no turn to stream into, and `useApp` now hands back the `status` the build window's poll was already receiving and discarding. A toast's hint moved under its text rather than beside its buttons, which is where it has to be to carry a sentence.
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps: the build now says what it is doing, and a sealed bundle renders in the host's own font. `BuildRequest.onStatus` was emitted by the build lane and supplied by nobody, so a build narrated itself to no one; the door now writes the lane's latest line onto the app row (`AppDocument.buildStatus`) and the pending poll answers with it (`PendingSurface.status`), which the forming card reads in place of the generic "Building …". One label, replaced each time — no stream, no subscription, no new route — and a status write that fails never fails the build. Brand fonts now travel with the brand tokens at render: `sendFrameTheme` carries the host's `.vendo/fonts.css` faces into the frame, which installs them as its own sheet, and the bundle route's CSP gains `font-src data:` so an inlined face can load. The seal still holds nothing font-related, and the frame still makes no network request of any kind.
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps: reviewer triage on the build lane. Escalating now ENDS the screen agent's turn, so a run cannot write a screen after asking for a build. A build is only offered where the deployment can also seal it, a refusal reads the app row at the moment it refuses (so a watchdog can no longer tombstone an app that has since been sealed, or stand one back up that was deleted mid-build), a seal clears any failure an earlier terminal write recorded, and a rejected seal writes no orphan blobs. The sealed bundle's document escapes a script end tag in any case, the frame answers a host call the host refused instead of leaving the app loading, re-sends the brand tokens when the host's palette or fonts change after boot, and requires the protocol's stamp on the boot handshake. The build's progress line is a live region, `useApp`'s `status` clears when the app lands, and a whitespace-only inference credential is treated as no credential.
- 7bbfd3f: seal a built app's bundle as content-addressed blobs: `sealBundleBlobs` freezes one build's files under `apps/<appId>/bundle/<sha256>` and describes them as an `AppBundle`, `readBundleBlob` reads one back by its hash. Keying by content rather than by path is what makes a seal immutable — a reseal mints fresh keys instead of overwriting the bytes an open tab is still rendering, and two concurrent seals cannot collide
- 7bbfd3f: Built apps do not travel. A sealed bundle is arbitrary code whose only door is the guarded tool bridge, so a copy would run its author's code with the recipient's own permissions — that seam ships with its own consent story. One artifact-kind check, `refuseBundleArtifact`, now refuses `share`, `publish`, `fork`, `exportApp`, `place` and the `access.grant` behind the ✦ share toggle, server-side at the enforcer rather than in the client, with a `blocked` error naming the operation. That grant is the share a person actually performs — `PUT /apps/:id/grants/:principal` never reaches `AppsRuntime.share` — so it is the path the refusal has to hold. Screens are untouched and stay shareable exactly as before.

### Patch Changes

- 97be645: The checks floor stops re-describing a fault inside a callback as a fault in the
  prop that carries it. A type error in an `onClick` body or a table's slot arrow
  was anchored on the enclosing JSX attribute, so the refusal printed the prop's
  declared signature against a value that already matched it — `prop "columns" on
<DataTable> takes a list of rows, but this value is a list of rows`. A sentence
  that contradicts itself has no repair that satisfies it, so a model reading it
  rewrites the one thing that was never wrong and is refused again, forever.

  The attribute-shaped sentence now requires the fault to be about the attribute:
  if a function boundary sits between the diagnostic and the attribute, the
  compiler's own sentence stands instead — `line 4: <Button> prop "onClick" Type
'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.` A fault in a member of an inline
  object or array literal the prop really is (`columns={[{ key, label: 5 }]}`)
  still reads as the prop's own, because there it is.

### Minor Changes

- 853c591: The slot registry is page-reported and nothing else. `createVendo({ slots })` is
  gone, and with it the merge that put a host's declared entries in front of the
  reports: a declared slot never decayed and beat a page report of the same id, so
  a declaration the product had outgrown was a silent black hole — the pin landed
  where no page displays it, and nothing ages that out. A slot is now known
  because a `<VendoSlot>` rendered, per user, refreshed on every render and aged
  out on its own after `SLOT_DECAY_MS`, so the list is always the places that
  really exist.

  Nothing declared config could say is lost. The one capability it carried beyond
  an id is `description` — the sentence an agent reads to pick between two slots a
  label alone cannot separate — and that already lives on the component:
  `<VendoSlot description="…">` reports it over the wire, through the registry, to
  the model.

### Patch Changes

- 91595d2: A remix's ✦ door stops authoring automations nobody asked for. Asking the ✦ on
  Maple's net-worth card for a caption that reads "Tracked monthly" used to open
  `vendo_make`'s compound arm, author a schedule 2 mints in 3, and repaint the
  remix as an automation board behind an "Allow all 34 & enable" consent wall —
  because the arm only sniffs the person's own words for a recurrence word, and a
  caption is not a schedule.

  A remix is the ✦ on one of the host's own components, and what it may do is
  edit that component, read its data, and call its declared actions — authoring
  an automation was never on that list. The compound arm no longer opens on a row
  that carries a `seed`, the same marker that already means "this is a remix", so
  neither the mint nor any later app-scoped wish can reach the automation door.
  The ask is never dropped in silence: the receipt says where schedules live, and
  that check sits ahead of the failed-build gate, since a failure is the loudest
  way to lose an ask. Reading the row now also fails closed — only `null` means
  "no row"; an unresolved read no longer gets treated as "not a remix". An
  ordinary app's compound ask still arms exactly as it did.

  - @vendoai/core@0.36.2

## 0.36.1

### Patch Changes

- a9fca38: A ✦ remix stops silently reverting the live props the courier just delivered.
  The remix would quietly go back to showing the values captured the day
  `vendo sync` ran, while the host's own component beside it showed today's — with
  nothing refused and nothing logged.

  The ✦ door twice read the app row and then put a whole document computed over
  that read: putting the mint's name back after the port's paint renamed the app,
  and marking a failed build over the row as it stands. Neither read-modify-write
  took a turn on the row, so the courier — which writes `seed.props` whenever the
  host re-renders, and re-renders all the way through a mint — could land its write
  between one of those reads and its put, and the put carried the pre-courier
  document straight back over it.

  Both now take the same turn on the row every other writer takes, read included,
  so the courier's write lands strictly before or strictly after them and never
  inside one. The save's assertion is untouched and stays strict: a genuine
  concurrent edit is still refused exactly as before. The courier's boundary is
  untouched too — the allowlist is still the captured baseline's own declared prop
  names, applied before anything is stored.

  - @vendoai/core@0.36.1

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 0108715: A remix follows the page it was forked from. The `<Remixable>` wrapper now
  couriers its wrapped instance's live serializable props to the server — on mount
  and again on every change — and the ported screen is painted on them.

  Until now it was painted on the baseline's `sampleProps`, captured the day
  `vendo sync` ran. Maple's remixed net-worth card read `$54,907.15` — the
  hardcoded declared example in the host's own registry — while the host's card two
  inches away read `$142,929.30`, with a visibly different chart series. A port
  renders FROM its props and a query resolves before the render, so nothing in the
  screen's source could ever have carried them; the capture was the only value the
  floor had.

  `AppSeed.props` records them, `POST /apps/:id/props` (`apps.seed.props`,
  `client.apps.courierProps`) is the door, and the checks floor's props resolver
  prefers them over the capture — which remains the fallback for a remix whose
  wrapper has not couriered yet. Writing props is provenance about the call site,
  not a content edit: it mints no version and replays no wish, so it is safe on
  every render the props really change on.

  The boundary is the captured baseline's own declared prop names, applied at the
  door, so a prop the host component never declared is dropped before it is stored.
  JSON-serializable values only, as before.

  Also removes the client-side splice this replaces. It searched the payload for a
  node named `seedComponentName(slot)` with `source: "generated"`; a remix is a
  ported SCREEN whose tree is whatever rendering produced — nodes marked
  `source: "ported"` — and that name only ever names a seat in
  `document.components`. The find never matched and the merge never ran, which is
  why the numbers were stale in the first place.

### Patch Changes

- f325443: The live-props courier waits its turn on the app row, so a ✦ remix stops failing
  to mint. One tap in three died with `app changed under this save`, at the moment
  a person first creates a remix.

  A save asserts the row is still byte-identical to the baseline it computed over
  and refuses otherwise, because a document computed over a stale row would revert
  the edit that landed there. That assertion cannot tell an edit from a write that
  is not one — and the courier is not one: it writes `seed.props` whenever the host
  re-renders, mints no version, and the `<Remixable>` wrapper starts couriering the
  moment discovery finds the freshly minted row, which is squarely inside the
  build. Landing inside a save's baseline-read→put window refused that save, and the
  mint reported the refusal as a failed build.

  The two writers take a turn on the row now, read included, so the courier's write
  lands strictly before or strictly after a save and never inside one. The save's
  assertion is untouched and stays strict: a genuine concurrent edit is still
  refused exactly as before, and a writer that does not come through the door is
  still caught. The courier's boundary is untouched too — the allowlist is still
  the captured baseline's own declared prop names, applied before anything is
  stored.

- 0b6bb92: A remix's wish list records what the person GOT, and a follow-up edit changes the
  port instead of replacing it.

  One follow-up ask on Maple was refused three times and left four entries on
  `seed.wishes` — a list every Update replays in order, so one ask became four
  edits the person never made. The front door recorded the ask whether or not the
  change landed, which is right for `memory.asks` (the next editor wants to read
  "asked for X, then asked for X again, narrower") and wrong for the replay list
  beside it. `AppsRuntime.remember` now takes `landed`, and only a change that
  reached the screen becomes a wish. The ask itself is still recorded either way,
  the list is still ordered and never trimmed, and an inapplicable wish still lands
  on `seed.unapplied` and is still said out loud.

  The fourth attempt then abandoned the ported source and rewrote the app out of
  the host's catalog, losing the first wish's edit. The port reaches the model
  through `startingSource`, which was filled from the CHECKOUT — and the checkout
  only ever fills an EMPTY workspace. So once the first edit's save had landed a
  file, every later edit of that remix arrived with no code at all in front of it
  (the loop has no file hand and cannot read the workspace itself), and an ask with
  nothing to change is answered out of the catalog. The stored screen is now read
  for every edit of a remix, not only the first; it is still never written over a
  file a save left behind. A port that genuinely cannot take an edit now fails
  through the one channel there is, rather than succeeding as a different app.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- ea60d95: An app can be shared again. `AppsRuntime.access` regains `list`, `grant` and
  `revoke` (viewer-scoped read, owner-scoped writes, each write answering with the
  resulting list), the wire mounts `GET /apps/:id/grants` and
  `PUT|DELETE /apps/:id/grants/:principal`, and the client regains
  `apps.grants/.share/.unshare`. The person picker and `promote` are deliberately
  not back.
- ea60d95: The ✦ menu offers one share. `useAppSharing` reads `GET /apps/:id/grants` once —
  the caller's level, the app's grants and the caller's own memberships — and
  `PinChrome` grows a single "Share with &lt;tenant&gt;" toggle between Update and
  Revert. It is absent for a non-owner and for a caller in no tenant, and the
  popover stays open when it is switched, because it is a switch rather than a
  departure.

  Sharing an app with a tenant now MOVES it there first. Every path that creates
  an app stamps it with the person, and core refuses a tenant grant on a
  still-personal app (ruled 2026-08-01) because the app's documents live under the
  holder's own `/user` mount — so `AppsRuntime.access.grant` mints the sharer's own
  owner grant, runs `ops.lifecycle.promote`, and only then writes the tenant grant.
  The order is load-bearing: the move restamps the row's subject as the org id, so
  a sharer who is not a tenant admin would otherwise lose the app she just shared.

  Because that move is what makes the grant legal, naming the tenant is now an
  authorization claim of its own: `grant` refuses a `team:`/`org:` principal with
  `forbidden` unless the caller holds an asserted membership in that org. Owning
  the app is not enough — without this an owner could name any org id and have her
  app moved into a workspace she does not belong to. Revoking is unchanged, so a
  sharer who has since left the tenant can still un-share.

### Minor Changes

- f7e0ff4: Host-declared slots: `createVendo({ slots })` names the places this deployment always has, instead of waiting for a page to report them.

  The slot registry is page-reported and ages out, so an agent-only product — where no page of yours renders a `<VendoSlot>` — had nowhere to pin a generated view. A declared slot never decays and needs no render. Declared and reported slots merge on read, and a declared entry wins over a page report of the same id.

### Minor Changes

- 8c7b476: Vendo runs on both AI SDK majors. The peer range widens from `ai >=6 <7` to
  `ai >=6 <8`, and the three things that made an `ai@7` host fail are gone: the
  turn loop and the generation engine send their cacheable system block as
  `system` instead of as a system-role message inside `messages` (ai@7 refuses the
  latter with `AI_InvalidPromptError`, and both majors carry the same message form
  — cache breakpoint and all — to the provider unchanged), and the spec-version
  gates on provider failover and the screen agent's per-role seat now admit the
  v4 spec that ai@7-era providers report instead of only v3.

  `vendo doctor` follows: `ai@6` and `ai@7` both pass, a pre-v6 install still
  fails on the peer floor, and E-DEP-001's ceiling moves to majors above the
  supported pair. `vendo init` stops telling an `ai@7` host to downgrade, and the
  "install your provider" line no longer names an `ai` major at all — `ai` is
  already resolved by the time anyone can read it.

  A new `ai-dual` CI lane pins the whole workspace to the ai@7 pairing and runs
  the suites against it, so a peer range that claims two majors is checked rather
  than asserted. This is the compat half of #478, whose short-term half was the
  fail-fast this replaces.

- 88cf572: The model formats every figure now — the chart `format`/`xFormat` tokens are
  gone, replaced by per-row formatter functions (`format={(row) => money(row.amount)}`),
  resolved in the screen VM like every other per-row slot; axis ticks keep plain
  digit grouping and never claim a unit. Timeline shows its time field as handed.
  `info` is a real theme color, host-settable and derived from the accent where
  unset — the Kit's hardcoded blue is gone. SegmentedControl speaks radio
  semantics (`role=radiogroup`, `aria-checked`), so its live segment is readable
  as selected rather than dead. The writer's manual teaches the Kit's real
  handler shapes, verbatim ids, and always-pressable ask verbs; the reviewer
  writes its reasoning before its verdict, so a finding can no longer contradict
  itself into a wasted repair round.

- 6bbc8e6: A screen may write `key` on a display brick again. The screen typings declared
  `key` once, on `JSX.IntrinsicAttributes` — but TypeScript intersects that into a
  value-based element only, never into an intrinsic tag, which takes
  `JSX.IntrinsicElements[tag]` verbatim. So `<Card key={id}>` compiled and
  `<li key={id}>` was a hard TS2322, while the format skill was telling the model
  to write `key={…}` on every row it maps: the product demanded exactly what its
  own checker refused. The refusal was unreadable on top of being wrong — a
  whole-attribute error attributed to the first attribute printed `prop "key" on
  <li> takes string | number, but this value is string`, so a model repairing the
  screen flipped `key={i}` and `key={String(i)}` until it ran out of rounds. The
  display bricks now carry `key` in their own props type, beside `children` and
  `style`.
  - @vendoai/core@0.30.1

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- bd1d016: Screens are natural JavaScript now. Reads take inputs and resolve through a
  supply loop that keeps the screen's state alive; per-row and plain slots take
  real closures; the `field=`/`semantic:` dialect, the slot law, the nesting
  whitelist and both auto-repair regexes are deleted. The sealed VM borrows the
  host's Intl, so money, dates, durations and "2 hours ago" print what a browser
  prints, pinned to the host's locale and zone. The Kit's surface answers the
  ecosystem's conventions — `value=`, `name`/`header`/children accepted, column
  `width`/`truncate`/`priority`, human durations, `grow`, icon/loading buttons,
  option groups — and twenty silent misbehaviors now speak up or behave. The
  screen agent's brief sheds the rules whose reasons died, gains worked examples,
  and tells the truth about the frame: everything the ask names must be visible.

  Breaking: the value-formatting tier is deleted — `Money`, `Percent`, `Num`,
  `DateTime` and the container `format` tokens are gone; screens format with the
  host-bridged Intl in their own code (chart axes keep a format token, the one
  place a value never passes through screen code). Also: `field=`,
  `semantic:`, `Percent whole` and the `percent` format token are gone — divide
  and scale where you prepare the data; slots accept elements or functions.

### Patch Changes

- b3d92b2: Generated screens render in a production build again. The screen engine and
  `$expr` rode the SINGLE-FILE QuickJS build, which carries its WebAssembly as a
  raw binary string inside the JavaScript — and that string cannot survive a
  modern minifier: the WASM bytes contain a backtick, SWC re-quotes the string
  with backticks, and the chunk that comes out opens a template literal whose
  `\0` bytes are illegal octal escapes. Turbopack's server, SSR and browser
  chunks were all unparseable, so the VM never started and the checks floor
  correctly refused every screen. The bytes now travel as a FILE: the wasmfile
  build's ten-kilobyte loader, handed the module through `wasmBinary` — read off
  disk on Node, fetched as a bundler-emitted asset everywhere else. `@vendoai/apps`
  ships `quickjs.wasm` beside its `dist`, and the QuickJS it installs drops from
  3.1MB to 1.2MB.

  And the variant a host hands `warmScreenEngine` now WINS. It used to be
  last-warm-wins, which meant `@vendoai/ui`'s own no-variant re-warm on the first
  screen mount silently took the engine back — so the documented hatch existed and
  never held, and a venue with no network and no asset URL (an offline
  single-bundle page, workerd) could not run screens at all. An explicitly passed
  variant is now kept: every later default warm is a no-op, and a default already
  in flight lands nowhere.

- 0484a15: The approval ask words its schedule and survives a verb-phrase title. Live
  2026-08-18, arming a balance check over text asked as "Set this to run on its
  own needs your approval: - when: _/15 _ \* \* _" — a sentence collision for a
  header and a cron expression as the one thing the person must understand
  before saying yes. The header gains an em dash ("Set this to run on its own —
  needs your approval:"), a schedule-shaped value is worded beside its verbatim
  self ("every 15 minutes (_/15 \* \* \* \*)" — beside, never instead: the ask is
  the consent boundary), argument labels cut at the first comma as well as the
  first period, and the automate tool's `when` property leads with the label
  consent surfaces show ("When it runs") while keeping its format teaching.
- 7e78031: Arming an automation is ONE page and ONE yes. Live 2026-08-18 on production
  Maple: a user armed "check my checking balance every 15 minutes and text me"
  entirely over iMessage, their YES to the job landed — and arming then minted four
  MORE per-tool asks (Text me, knowledge search, request a connection, list
  connections). Three were reads nobody needs a second opinion about, and the
  fourth was literally in the sentence they had just typed. Consent was framed
  per-tool while the person was thinking per-job.

  The authoring call's own approval now NAMES what the automation will hold, and
  that one yes mints all of it. The powers ride on the approval record
  (`ApprovalRequest.powers`, additive and optional, human titles only), computed
  once at park time by the composition and rendered verbatim by whoever reads it —
  the text channel today, any other surface without further work. They are grouped
  the way a person reads them: the tools that DO something named one by one, and
  every read folded into a single trailing "Read-only access to your data", because
  naming reads individually is exactly what turned a yes to a job into a wall of
  tool names.

  What an automation is granted has NOT changed, and neither has how it runs. The
  surface is as wide as it ever was, every away call is still grant-backed, and 05
  §6's away authority is untouched — the guard's law suites pass unmodified. Two
  kinds are excluded from standing powers because a grant could never satisfy them
  and the card would be promising what the run will not honour: `destructive` and
  `ungraded` (§12's pair, now closed on the two branches that leaked — a steps
  record's declared destructive tool, and a connector slug the risk resolver grades
  destructive), and `confirmEach`, which needs a person every time.

  Minting is gated on a person having actually been asked. `enable()` takes the
  authoring call (`armedBy`); when the host's policy would have asked about it, the
  call reaching the engine proves the ask was answered, so the powers are minted on
  the spot. When policy would have run it unasked — `vendo_make` is read-graded —
  nobody saw a powers page, so nothing is minted and each power is captured as a
  pending ask exactly as before, delivered by the grant-set text.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 0143c4e: The stored `tree` leaves the app document. The model never writes layout and no
  production door mints a tree-only app — an app IS its `app.tsx`, and its tree is
  what RENDERING that produces — so the field, the branch that served it, the paint
  path gated on it and the fact checks that walked it are all deleted.

  What changes for a host: `AppDocument.tree` is gone from the type and the schema,
  and `.vendoapp` no longer carries it. A row written before this still opens — the
  field is STRIPPED on the way out of the store and on the way in, never refused —
  because such a document opens on its `source` like any other. A document with no
  usable source at all now RESOLVES as `{kind:"failed"}` with a reason naming why,
  instead of throwing and leaving an embed to poll to its deadline; importing a
  `.vendoapp` that holds a layout and no source is refused in the same words rather
  than minting a row that can never open.

  BREAKING for a host's own checks: a check that read `document.tree` reads
  `undefined` now and will never see a tree there again. The rendered tree moves
  onto `CheckInput.renderedTree`, beside `document` and `request`, where it belongs —
  it is what the person is about to see, not something a document carries — and
  every such check must move to that field.

  The tree as a RENDER language is untouched — `UIPayload`/`TreeNode`, the
  renderer, the streamed view parts, the render seam, and `ui: "tree"` as the
  surface kind all stay exactly as they were.

- 0143c4e: An embed watching a code-first build now paints the app TAKING SHAPE instead of a
  bar. `GET /apps/:id/open?pending=1` carries the `tree` it always had room for, and
  what fills it is the render the build already made: a code-first build renders its
  half-written `app.tsx` on every landed commit to decide whether anything may paint
  at all, and that render's SHAPE is now offered to the build-window poll.

  Geometry only, through the same whitelist that shipped with the wire field — node
  ids, component names and nesting, tagged `streaming`. No props, no resolved data,
  no interactive VM, no component sources: a build's draft carries figures its repair
  round is about to correct, and nobody may be shown a number the build is about to
  change.

  The renderer paints that shape node by node. A node the build has not filled in
  yet — a name and a place, no props — now holds its own silhouette instead of
  nothing, so a screen written from layout and text grows across paints rather than
  sitting behind one skeleton until it lands.

  Nothing is persisted. No document keeps a tree; the shape lives in the serving
  process's memory for the length of the build and nowhere else, so a poll served
  before the first paint — or by another process — finds nothing and the embed reads
  its beat bar, exactly as it did before.

### Patch Changes

- ebe9ffc: A store that will not hold one collection no longer takes the whole deployment down with it.

  0.27.0 on a Vendo Cloud key served 501 to every route. The hosted store's engine allowlist did not carry two of the collections this version reads — `vendo_automations` and `vendo_app_seen` — and the automations one is read at BOOT, by the code-automations reconcile that rides the `ready()` latch. The latch memoizes, so the first refusal became every route's answer for the life of the process: 2.3 seconds for the first request, 3 milliseconds for every one after, all of them 501, including the routes that never touch an automation.

  Three separate faults, and the deployment needed all three fixed:

  The boot reconcile is no longer the deployment. A store that refuses the automations read leaves code-authored automations off and says so once, in a line the operator can act on; everything else serves. Scoped to that one read — every per-request store failure still fails in the open, where the caller can see it.

  The unseen dot costs the dot, never the answer. `vendo_app_seen` was read on the path that LISTS a person's apps and written on every render, so a store refusing that collection took the whole page of apps with it. A refusal is absorbed there now, once per process, and the apps arrive without their arrival dots.

  And `instanceof VendoError` does not survive a realm boundary. A host bundle can carry two copies of `@vendoai/core` — the ESM `dist/` beside the CJS `dist/cjs/` — and the second copy's VendoErrors are a different class with the same shape, so every `instanceof` gate said no. That is why a blocked collection reached the wire's catch-all as an unknown fault and answered "Internal Vendo error" instead of its own 403.

  `isVendoError` is the check that survives it: `name` plus `code`, the two things any of these gates actually read. Every type-gate in the repo takes it now — 48 of them across the eight packages that had one — because the failure was never specific to the wire. The same class of error decided whether a lost compare-and-swap re-aimed or crashed the workspace façade, whether a swept approval rendered "expired" or an error card, whether a host's knowledge adapter got its code named in the operator's log, whether a permission route answered 403 or threw, and whether a build's "busy, try again shortly" read as "generation failed" — a verdict on an ask that was never the problem. `@vendoai/harnesses` proved the duck check first and kept a private copy of it; that copy is now this one function.

- ebe9ffc: A polled resource that keeps failing now backs off instead of holding its
  cadence. `useResource` re-armed the next poll at the same interval whatever came
  back, so a wire saying "no" was asked again at exactly the rate it was refusing:
  an idle host produced 75 rate-limited calls in eight minutes, because the connect
  dock's badge polls every 3s and the overlay keeps it mounted whether or not
  anyone opens the panel. Consecutive failures now double the interval — jittered
  so the several pollers one page mounts stop re-colliding, capped at a minute, and
  reset by the first success. Every hook that takes `pollMs` inherits it; the fix
  is in the one place they all share.

  `@vendoai/ui`'s entry points carry `"use client"`. Only the umbrella's
  `@vendoai/vendo/react` had it, so a host importing `@vendoai/ui`,
  `@vendoai/ui/chrome`, `/kit` or `/tree` straight into a Next App Router tree got
  the hooks as server code. All four are client boundaries now, which meant
  retiring `export *` from three of them: Next's flight loader builds its
  client-reference manifest by statically enumerating a client module's named
  exports and errors outright on a star. The exported surface is unchanged, name
  for name.

  `@vendoai/apps`'s optional `typescript` peer widens from the exact `6.0.3` to
  `>=5.6.0 <7`. That pin is the provenance of the `/edge` toolchain's vendored
  compiler bytes, not a claim on the host's own compiler, and it printed a peer
  warning on every stock install. The exact version the edge toolchain wants is
  `EDGE_TYPESCRIPT_VERSION`, now stated on the edge-runtimes page.

- ebe9ffc: Three lines that promised more than the code does.

  The `DataTable` spec now names the two priors a model keeps bringing to it: a column's header text is `label` — there is no `header` prop — and `paginate` is a page SIZE, so no pagination means omitting it rather than passing `false`. Both mistakes are silent from the model's side: an unknown prop is dropped at validation and `paginate={false}` never parses, so the screen simply comes back missing the thing that was asked for.

  Init's closing line no longer says `vendo doctor` "can start the server and run a live turn". Doctor makes no requests at all — it validates files and wiring — so the sentence sold a check it was never going to run, and a reader who trusted it counted a green doctor as proof the app answers.

  The brief stage's failure note names the artifact it already preserved. `brief stage failed (Unterminated string at position 1873) — keeping the current brief` gave nobody anything to open; it now points at `.vendo/data/extract/brief.json`, where the stage's raw output is written on the way out.

- ebe9ffc: The Kit's props keep their real types under zod 4, instead of every one of them becoming `string`.

  `@vendoai/apps` takes zod as a peer, so the Kit's schemas are built by whatever zod the HOST installed — and two walkers read those schemas: the checks floor's TypeScript printer, which decides whether a screen sets props that exist with types that fit, and the catalog prompt, which tells the model what each prop takes. Both switched on `_def.typeName` against `z.ZodFirstPartyTypeKind`. zod 4 tags a def with `_def.type` and ships no such enum, so every `case` compared `undefined` against `undefined`, the first one matched, and every prop in the Kit typed as `string`.

  What that looks like on a real deployment: `gap?: string` where the Kit says number, `density?: string` where it says a two-word enum, `rows: string` where it says an array of records. 37 "takes string" refusals against real screens, nothing painting, and the agent reporting success over it. The `default:` branch that exists so a prop we cannot type precisely degrades to `any` — never to a false finding — was unreachable, so the failure was silent as well as total.

  Both walkers now read one normalized answer from a single place that knows both layouts. The two are not merged field by field, because they collide: zod 3 keeps an array's element in `_def.type`, which is the field zod 4 uses for the tag, and zod 3 gives every object a `catchall` while zod 4 gives one only to an object that really keeps undeclared keys. So the tag decides how the rest of the def is read. Anything wearing neither tag — a construct outside the vocabulary, a stub, nothing at all — reaches the `any` net, which now has tests standing on it.

  The zod-3 output is unchanged, byte for byte. The peer range did not move; this is what makes its claim true.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 49e1e39: The theme is the default, no longer the law: every Kit component takes `style`, and the ones wrapping an engine pass that engine's own props through.

  The Kit used to expose no color input anywhere — a design law ("never invents a color") that read as brand safety and played out as a dead end: a person asked for rainbow chart lines, the model wrote the hexes into the app, and the surface painted theme grey while the assistant claimed otherwise. Now `style` lands on every component's root (user values winning over Kit defaults), chart components pass recharts props through — including per-series, where `color` on a series entry paints the line's stroke or the bar's fill — and Base UI-backed components pass theirs. Wiring props the component must own (data keys, ids) stay Kit-owned; a passthrough prop that was never set keeps the theme's default rather than blanking it.

  The agent-facing docs say all of this plainly (theme by default, engine props when the person asks), and the checks admit engine props instead of flagging them. No compatibility promise rides along: an engine upgrade may retire a prop an old stored app used, and that app renders with theme defaults until regenerated.

- af2d337: A host tool that is off says so, and a screen with nothing to read says that instead of inventing a tool.

  An extracted tool can be turned off by three different layers, and until now only the all-or-nothing case was ever announced: `warnZeroLiveTools` fired when EVERY tool was dead, doctor passed on any `live > 0`, and the init receipt never mentioned it. So a catalog that shipped 5 tools and served 2 read healthy from every angle, and the missing three were discovered by watching the assistant fail to answer.

  Now the count and the reason travel together. Boot warns once naming each tool that is off and the layer that took it (an override, a judgment, or a non-end-user audience grade). `vendo doctor` warns `E-TOOLS-005` with the same list when live is short of the extracted count — a warning, not a failure, because which exclusions are right is the host's call. The `vendo init` agent tail carries a `tools off:` line with the same names and the one edit that turns a tool back on.

  The generator stops filling that silence with fiction. When no tool on the list can be READ, the briefing says so outright, and a screen that queries an unknown tool with nothing readable behind it is told there is no data for the ask, to use `<Disclaimer>`, and specifically not to claim data is missing or empty when it cannot know. The failure this closes: a model invented a tool name, failed five times, then rendered "No revenue data connected" above a table of that exact data.

- c50597f: Two doors author an automation now: `agent.on(...)` in your own code, and `vendo_automate` when a person asks in chat.

  `support.on(when, task, options?)` is a DECLARATION, never a store write — it validates where you wrote it and `createVendo` reconciles it at boot. All five `When` shapes:

  ```ts
  support.on("0 9 * * 1", "summarize the week and email ops");
  support.on({ every: "1d" }, "refresh credit scores");
  support.on({ at: "2026-09-01T09:00:00Z" }, "send the launch note");
  support.on({ event: "payment.failed" }, "triage and notify the user");
  support.on({ webhook: "stripe" }, "reconcile the payout");
  support.on("0 2 * * *", "rebuild the digest", { id: "nightly-digest" });
  ```

  A bad cron throws at module load, not at 2am, with what, why, a did-you-mean you can paste and the docs link. The code is the consent, so a redeploy reconciles: new → created, edited → a new identity with the old one disarmed, deleted from your source → disarmed (never deleted, so its run history survives). Identity defaults to `hash(when + task + agent)`, so editing the cron or the words MINTS a new automation — pass `id` to keep one across an edit. A `disable()` a person did stamps `disarmedBy: "user"`, and that kill switch survives every redeploy.

  `@vendoai/agents` newly exports `agentAutomations`, `agentAutomationPlan` and `OnOptions`. The plan is built here and applied only by the engine's own internal reconcile: this package may not import `@vendoai/automations`, so there is no second write path to disagree with the first. Agent names ride through verbatim — two agents claiming one name produce two declarations both claiming that runner name, because collapsing them here would hide a collision the runner map has to throw on at startup.

  `vendo_automate` is the chat door — a schedule with nothing to build. It takes `{ task, when?, agent?, timezone? }` and carries **no app argument of any kind**, because a record has no app slot to fill. `vendo_make` still arms the schedule half of a compound ask ("build me the board and refresh it every Monday") and does it by calling the same one create operation, so the two cannot drift into arming differently. The `vendo.json` manifest fold-in is a reconcile through the same core helper: a changed cron replaces its own record under the same identity, a schedule dropped from the manifest disarms its own, an unchanged manifest touches nothing, and two schedules that collapse to one identity are refused out loud rather than last-wins.

  **Breaking, and the reason your app writes may start failing:** every triggers-in-documents path is gone rather than shimmed — `app-validation`, the edit journal, interchange, persistence, the runtime types and the write surface all lost their trigger halves. An app document that still carries `triggers` no longer arms anything. What an app may hold instead is an optional `automations: string[]`, maintained by this layer alone (the compound flow and the manifest fold-in, nowhere else) and resolved on read. Deleting the app does NOT stop its automation: the automation fires, reaches for the tool its task named, and fails loudly with a `not-found` that becomes a terminal error run row.

  One misuse hole closed on the way past. `vendo_automate`'s `when` now requires exactly one of `every` / `at` / `event` / `webhook` (or a bare cron string) and refuses the rest, naming what it got and where the shapes are written down. An object naming none of them used to become `{ kind: "external", connector: undefined }` — an automation nothing could ever trigger, reported to its owner as armed.

- a6ec9ba: An app now arrives somewhere a person can see it, and takes shape while they
  watch. Generated apps used to appear by surprise and load behind a generic
  shimmer: nothing said an app was new, a build in flight was a spinner with no
  information in it, and a pinned app had no handle at all.

  Arrival is a per-person flag, server-side. `AppsRuntime.seen(appId, ctx)` is the
  idempotent mark, `AppsRuntime.list` now answers `AppListRow[]` — the document
  plus an `unseen?: boolean` this caller's read alone can say — and the rows
  carry it through `VendoClient.apps.list()` to `useAttention().unseenApps`, which
  lights the launcher's quiet dot. Precedence is unchanged: a waiting decision
  still shows the numbered badge instead, and `unseenResults` now means a finished
  run OR an app nobody has looked at (the pill's spoken line names neither half).
  Rendering marks it, and only rendering to a PERSON does: `GET /apps/:id/open`
  records it, while the same runtime door an MCP client or an automation reaches
  through does not, so an agent reading a tree never clears somebody's dot. Rows
  live in `vendo_app_seen`, which puts the engine allowlist at
  `ENGINE_ALLOWLIST_VERSION` 3, and they are swept when the app is deleted.

  A build in flight is now visible instead of merely slow. `AppsRuntime.open`
  takes `{ pending?: true }` and answers `PendingSurface` with an optional `tree`
  — the forming payload's GEOMETRY, node ids and nesting and no data values — so
  the embed's existing 1.2s poll paints stepped assembly off the same request
  rather than a bar, and never shows a number it will take back. Unfinished
  sections render wet (dim, desaturated) and dry to full ink as they land, once,
  with the hairline ring following the last one. Slots remember the shape of the
  app they held and wait in its silhouette rather than a shimmer, and a placed app
  carries the ✦ handle: Edit in chat (`OpenConversationOptions.appId` features the
  app on the stage and prefills the composer), Refresh, Unpin. The pin flight
  lands flush and its confirmation ring now waits for the placement write
  (`PinCeremonyOptions.confirmed`) instead of an animation timer.

- c50597f: **Breaking.** An automation is a first-class principal-owned RECORD, not an app with a list of triggers. `AppDocument.triggers` is deleted, every automation verb keys off one automation id, and stored automations are NOT migrated — they stop firing at the upgrade and have to be authored again.

  **Tell your users before you deploy this.** Their existing automations lived inside `AppDocument.triggers`; nothing reads that field any more, and nothing converts one into a record. They re-create them (`agent.on(...)` in your code, or by asking in chat). Their run history goes too: `vendo_runs` is emptied once, because an app-keyed run row has no read path and no erase selector left to reach it.

  ## What breaks in your code

  **`@vendoai/core`.** `AppDocument.triggers` is gone, and these exports with it: `Trigger`, `triggerSchema`, `RunModel`, `runModelSchema`, `DEFAULT_TRIGGER_ID`, `TRIGGER_ID_PATTERN`, `triggerKindRefKey`, `TRIGGER_KIND_REF_KEYS`, `TRIGGER_KIND_REF_PRESENT` and `triggerKindRefs`. An app now holds at most `automations?: AutomationId[]` — a list of NAMES the apps layer maintains and resolves on read, not a foreign key, so dead ids simply drop out and there is no cascade to run. Writing `triggers` into an app document arms nothing. New in `automation.ts`: `AutomationRecord`, `When` and the one `toTriggerSource` converter, `AutomationTask`, `Budget`, `automationHash` and `reconcileAutomations`. `TriggerRef.id` is `TriggerRef.automationId`, and `PermissionGrant.triggerId` / `MintGrantInput.triggerId` are `automationId` — a record has no app id for the old pair's other half to name.

  **`vendo.automations`.** `enable` / `disable` / `dryRun` take ONE id instead of `(appId, triggerId)`. `list({ owner?, agent? }, ctx)` returns plain redacted `AutomationRecord[]`, deployment-wide. There is **no `app` filter** and there will not be one: a record carries no app reference at all, so an app page filters by resolving its own `automations` list and dropping the dead ids. `runs.list` filters on `{ automationId, owner, agent, status, cursor }`, and `RunRecord.appId`/`.triggerId` become `.automationId` plus `.owner` and an optional `.agent` — one ledger, with the owner, agent and console views as filters over it rather than tables of their own.

  **`createAutomations` config.** `apps`, `runner`, `appAccess` (and the `AppAccessSeam` type), `localTriggerKinds` and `AutomationsEngine.onDocumentEdit` are gone; so is the `triggerKey` export. `@vendoai/automations` depends on `@vendoai/core` alone now — a goal run reaches a brain through the named runner map the umbrella registers, and a task reaches an app only by naming one of that app's functions as an ordinary granted tool, which resolves through the bound registry like anything else. Delete an app and its automation still fires, then fails loudly at tool resolution with a `not-found` in the run ledger. The engine no longer watches app-document edits either: sponsorship is bound to the record's own content hash (`automationHash`), so a record whose content changed under a live sponsorship stops on its own. `@vendoai/automations` newly exports `verifySignature`, `signedWebhookBytes` and `base64url` — the one implementation of the standard-webhooks scheme, so the tick door and the per-record webhook path cannot drift.

  **`@vendoai/ui`.** `AutomationEntry` IS `AutomationRecord` (`AutomationTriggerEntry` is gone). `client.automations.{enable,disable,dryRun}` take one id; `client.runs.list` takes the new filter. `<AutomationCard>` takes `when` (a `TriggerSource`) plus an already-humanized `action` string instead of `trigger`, and `automationRule(when, action)` takes both halves — a record's task is the producer's to read, and a card that guessed at the words would put them in an automation's mouth.

  ## What breaks in your store

  Schema **v11**. `vendo_automations` is the new table: `subject` is the erase-cascade selector, because a row carries a live webhook signing key and a record that outlived its owner's erasure would be a hole rather than an untidiness; `revision` is the compare-and-swap counter every write bumps. `vendo_runs` re-keys `app_id` to `automation_id` and is **emptied once**, guarded on the old column. `vendo_grants` re-keys `trigger_id` to `automation_id`. The `trigger_kind_*` generated columns on `vendo_apps` are dropped by pattern, so the names leave the codebase entirely. The erase cascade deletes runs BEFORE automations, while the join that identifies them still exists.

  `ENGINE_ALLOWLIST_VERSION` goes 2 → 4. `vendo_automations` joins the engine allowlist; `automations:armed` and `automations:webhook` leave it — armed is a FIELD on the record, so a disarm is one write with no second row to keep in step, and the webhook secret lives on the record. If your BYO store pins the allowlist version, bump it.

- b10d129: The screen manual names every CSS variable it tells a screen to style with, generated from the emitter that sets them.

  The manual has always said to style the display tags off the host's own CSS variables, and it named exactly two as examples — `--vendo-color-accent` and `--vendo-density-content-gap`. `themeCssVariables` sets 52. A model reaching for the surface color, a radius, a chart series or any of the thirteen density steps had to guess the name, and a wrong guess is silent: CSS resolves an unknown variable to nothing and the declaration falls back, with no error on any surface.

  `references/format.md` now ends with the whole list — each name and a few words of what it is for — walked off `VENDO_THEME_VARIABLE_NAMES`, which is itself read off `themeCssVariables`. The names cannot fall behind a rename or an addition, exactly as the component catalog cannot; only the meanings are written by hand, and a meaning left behind fails a drift test instead of teaching a dead name. Values stay out — they are the host's and per-theme, and the briefing pack already carries them.

### Patch Changes

- e09d69a: A store that could not answer no longer reads as a build that produced nothing.

  `create` and `edit` both prove an assembly by reading the app's row back: a paint is what creates the row, so no row means nothing rendered. Both reads swallowed every failure into that same conclusion — a rate-limited or dropped read became "the build produced nothing renderable", which tells the person their screen failed and sends them to rebuild work that assembled and painted fine.

  Only an ABSENT row takes that path now. `engine.get` says absence with `null`, so a throw is the store failing and it is classified as what it is; the edit door's read-back distinguishes a genuine `not-found` from everything else and reports the store's own words otherwise. `buildFailureReason` gains the matching class: a `VendoError("unavailable")` — the server's own dependency saying "not now", including a cloud 429 — is "busy, try again shortly" and retryable, rather than "generation failed", which reads as a verdict on the ask.

- a781798: Every prop in the generated component catalog now says what it TAKES, and every brick carries one worked example. A line used to give prop NAMES only — `<DateTime> … · data: value · config: mode compact` — which tells a model nothing about whether `mode` wants a word from a closed list, a number or a function, and a prop written in the wrong shape is silently dropped at validation. Each prop is now `name: type`, with the type walked off its own zod schema: enums enumerated (`mode: "date"|"time"|"datetime"|"relative"`), primitives plain (`gap: number`), object shapes as their field names (`columns: {key?, label?, format?, align?, cell?}[]`), a handler as `fn`, a slot as `element`. The prop classes (`data` / `config` / `copy`) stay in front, because law 1 rides on them. Nothing is hand-written, so a schema that changes changes the prompt in the same commit.

  Under each line sits that component's first worked example, taken from the same place `kitPrompt` takes it, so the two prompts can never show a model different idioms. Seven examples still wrote the retired attribute dialect — `onClose="ui.cancel"`, `$state.confirming`, an inline tool call for data, and a `<KeyValue pairs=…>` naming a prop that does not exist — and are corrected to the shape a screen actually compiles: state and setters for the overlays, `useQuery` results for the data.

  The catalog costs 29,081 characters, up from 20,396; it still costs less than the 36,158 that a section per brick costs for the same bricks with no icon names at all.

- e09d69a: A deployment that cannot check screens now says so once, with the fix, instead of paying a model to rewrite a screen nobody read.

  When `@vendoai/apps` cannot reach esbuild — the field case is a bundled host that never named it an external — the component gauntlet refuses every screen it is handed. That refusal used to travel as an ordinary finding: the screen agent relayed it to the writing model under "Fix each of these, then write the file again", the model rewrote a perfectly good screen, the next save was refused for the same reason, and the run ended in a generic "that build didn't come together" after burning its whole step budget. Nothing anywhere named the one thing that would have fixed it.

  Three changes, one line of cause: the unavailability names its own remedy — keep `@vendoai/apps` out of the server bundle, which on Next is the `serverExternalPackages` list `vendo init` writes; naming `esbuild` alone does nothing, because this package hides that import behind a variable specifier and a bundler never sees an "esbuild" import to match — the gauntlet marks the refusal as the DEPLOYMENT's rather than the screen's, the checks floor carries the mark out (`ComponentPaintResult.environment`), and the screen agent ends the run on it — the floor's sentence becomes the answer the person and the host log both get, at a cost of one model call rather than a rewrite round per save.

  All three of the gauntlet's machines are marked, because all three fail the same way: no compiler (`toolchain-unavailable`), no type checker (`typecheck-unavailable`), and an engine that would not START, which now has its own code (`engine-unavailable`) instead of sharing `run` with screens that ran.

  A screen the floor refuses on its own merits is untouched — including one that RAN and threw, which is what `run` still means. Those sentences are still repair instructions, verbatim, because they are still repairable.

  Also: a run whose every save was refused has no app row — a paint is what creates one — so its `decisions` have nowhere to land. That expected state is an info line now, in the same voice `commitSource` already uses for it, rather than a warning that sends an operator hunting for a broken memory door.

- 20aed63: `StoreOps.appData` is OPTIONAL, on the same rule the other four optional members
  already follow: a store with nowhere to keep app rows says so by OMITTING the
  family, rather than shipping a stub that accepts the call and does something
  else. A store that omits it is refused at the door onto app rows — `/box/rows`
  answers the `not-implemented` refusal it already gave a store with no
  named-operation surface at all — and the app-storage backing falls through to
  the same façade path that store already took.

  Nothing changes for the stores this repo ships: `createStoreOps` (the local
  backend) and `hostedStoreOps` (the Cloud client) both serve the family, and both
  now say so in their return type, `StoreOpsWithAppData`. The StoreOps conformance
  kit reports its appData cases as OMITTED for a mount without the family instead
  of crashing on the first verb.

- 77a6765: A closure written into a Kit slot fails the screen check instead of painting a blank cell. `cell: (row) => <Money/>` is the React-shaped wrong answer, and the screen VM serializes any function prop as a `$handler` door — so the table was handed a callback where an element belonged and rendered empty cells while compile, types, paint and tree all passed. A slot's zod schema now carries a marker the component screen's typings read, so a slot prints as an element type rather than `any`, and the refusal names the slot, the column it sits in, and the element to write instead. `Tabs.tabs[].content`, `Accordion.items[].content` and `Tooltip.content` spelled their own `z.unknown()` rather than the shared slot, so each was the same hole; they share it now.

  `Tooltip.content` also takes the element its own prop documents. The slots table had no entry for Tooltip, so the tree check refused `content={<Text …/>}` — the documented form — while the Kit component painted it perfectly well. The entry is there now, on the read-only value tier: a hover popup is read, never operated.

- c369e14: **Breaking:** one model seat per real job — `default`, `apps`, `review`, `judge` — and the old spellings are gone rather than deprecated.

  `createVendo({ models })` now takes exactly the four jobs that run: `default` thinks (chat, compaction, subagents, automations), `apps` writes the generated apps, `review` grades the finished ones, `judge` answers the guard's run/ask/block. The old vocabulary named things nobody could act on — `fill` was the app writer, `reviewer` was read by nothing at all, and the app-writing agent silently read `default` while `paint` configured a lane that no longer existed. A seat you cannot point at a job is a seat you cannot set correctly.

  Gone, each with a boot error naming its replacement:

  - top-level `model` → `models.default`
  - top-level `paint` → `models.apps` for the model half, `apps: false` for `disabled`
  - the `fill` seat → `apps`; the `reviewer` seat → `review` (which never had a reader and now has one: the AI reviewer)
  - `devModel()` → `vendoModel()`
  - `VENDO_MODEL_PAINT` → `VENDO_MODEL_APPS`; `VENDO_MODEL_REVIEW` is new
  - the `VENDO_EXTRACTION_MODEL` fallback → `VENDO_MODEL_EXTRACT`
  - `migrateModelSeats()`, which no production path called

  Cloud gateway family ids follow the seats: `vendo`, `vendo-apps`, `vendo-review`, `vendo-judge`, `vendo-extract`. `vendo-paint` is gone, and `vendo-review` is new — so is its env pin, which the reviewer seat never had.

  Resolution is one rule stated once: an explicit seat wins; an unset seat borrows `default` — the object when you passed one, its own rung pick when `default` rode the credential ladder. On the Cloud rung each seat resolves to its own family id; on a BYO provider key the reading seats (`review`, `judge`) take the provider's fast model and the writing seats (`default`, `apps`) take its flagship. The app-writing agent now genuinely runs on the seat named after it — it read `default` before, so `models.apps` was a knob that changed nothing.

### Minor Changes

- 42b2b78: The Kit implements the 34 slots the table was shrunk to leave out.

  `SLOTS` shipped at what the React Kit actually painted — two of thirty-seven — because a declared slot the component drops is worse than no slot at all: the prompt teaches it, every check admits it, and the person gets a blank. The rest were deferred, not descoped. They land here, table entry and implementation together, and `slot-drift.test.tsx` renders a probe into every one of them and fails unless it finds it in the DOM.

  New places to write an element: a `header` and `footer` on Surface, Card and (with `actions`) Form; a `toolbar`, per-row `rowActions` and `empty` on DataTable; `actions` and `empty` on CardList; `empty` on Timeline; `empty`, `legend` and a per-point `tooltip` on LineChart, BarChart and DonutChart; `icon` on Stat; `marker` on Steps; `actions` on Tabs; `prefix`, `suffix` and `hint` on Input; `hint` and a `footer` on Textarea; `hint` on DatePicker; `label` on Divider. Four props widen from a scalar to take an element as well as the value they took before — `Progress.label`, `EmptyState.icon` (still a lucide name when it is a string), `DonutChart.legend` (still `false` to take the built-in key away), and each control's `hint`.

  A chart's `tooltip` publishes the hovered point on `RowContext`, so the value components inside name their field exactly as a table cell's do — the cell contract, per point. It renders through a function rather than as a bare element, because recharts clones whatever element it is handed with eighteen of its own internal props and React writes every one of them onto the DOM node.

  An `empty` slot replaces the container's dashed box rather than its text: what goes in one is an `EmptyState`, which draws that frame itself, and nested it read as a box inside a box.

  Every slot also gets its entry in the component's `props`, the way `Timeline.cell` and `Timeline.marker` already had one. The screen typings and the wire's allowed-prop set are printed from `props` alone, so a slot declared only in `SLOTS` is one the catalog teaches and `components-exist` then refuses by name. **This fixes `Modal.header`, `Modal.footer`, `Sheet.header` and `Sheet.footer`, which are in that state on `main` today** — declared, taught, painted, and blocked at the floor. A new sweep pins the rule for every slot there will ever be.

  `Select.hint` is the one slot from the worklist not implemented here.

### Minor Changes

- 6856b4f: A screen mounts only once its build is terminal.

  A screen saves as it goes, so its app ROW lands at the first save that paints — and the mandatory reviewer pass and its one repair round run after that. Every surface that mounts from the row stops looking the moment `open()` answers, so a person could be left in front of a draft — a wrong NUMBER included — while the server already held the corrected version, with nothing but a page reload to fix it.

  `AppDocument.building` (`@vendoai/core`, optional, server-written) is that window made durable: the first painting save of a build stamps it, and `open()` answers the same not-found the app gave a moment earlier with no row at all — which the wire's build window already turns into the `{kind:"pending"}` every embed keeps polling on. So there are no client changes: `useApp` and `VendoAppEmbed` both branch on it today, and `VendoSlot` gets "building" off the placement read. The trade is deliberate: first paint waits for the repair.

  `buildInFlight(building)` is new on `@vendoai/apps/contract`, and it is time-bounded on purpose — past the UI build deadline either the watchdog landed a terminal record or the build's process died, and a flag that never cleared would leave the app unmountable forever.

  The window is wired ONCE, around `assemble` itself, so the two doors that run an assembler cannot disagree about when a build ends, and a `finally` settles a run that threw or escalated. A harness writing `app.tsx` straight through the workspace is untouched — there is no build behind that save to be unfinished.

- 6856b4f: Display bricks — the HTML a screen may write, contained by its box.

  A screen had exactly one vocabulary: the Kit. Every arrangement it could not express had to be faked with a container that was never meant for it, and `<div>` was a type error. A screen now has ~21 display-only tags beside the Kit — `div`, `span`, `section`, `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `h1`–`h6`, `p`, `strong`, `em`, `small`, `code`, `blockquote`, `ul`, `ol`, `li` — each taking children and an inline `style`, and nothing else. Free CSS, off the host's own theme variables.

  `DISPLAY_SPECS` and `DISPLAY_TAG_NAMES` are new on `@vendoai/apps/contract` (kit) and are the single source: the renderer resolves bricks beside `KIT_COMPONENTS`, the screen typings print them as the ONLY `JSX.IntrinsicElements` (so `<img>` and `<script>` stay errors, and `className` is an error on the tag), the type-check refusal names the legal tags, the tree's catalog check skips them like a text run, and the prompt and format reference teach them.

  Security stays capability-shaped, never content-inspected. There is no style validator and no provenance scanner:

  - Each brick is written out by hand and destructures exactly `style` and `children`. No spread, so `className`/`id`/`on*`/`data-*`/`aria-*`/`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` cannot arrive — not because a list refuses them, but because nothing carries them.
  - ONE trusted-side filter drops the declarations that would FETCH (`url()`, `src()`, `image-set()`). A screen has no network; a beacon is a beacon whatever the URL says. The filter normalizes before it tests, the way the CSS tokenizer does: input preprocessing (CRLF, lone CR and form feed to one newline; NUL and lone surrogates to U+FFFD) and then escape resolution, so `\75 rl(`, `u\72 l(`, the fully-escaped spelling and every one of those routed through a custom property are caught — all reproduced fetching in real Chromium first. Honest framing: this closes every bypass we can demonstrate. It is a normalization pass, not a proof of completeness.
  - The surface root paints inside its own box: `contain: layout paint; overflow: clip; position: relative; isolation: isolate`. `contain: paint` makes it the containing block for fixed descendants, so `position: fixed; width: 200vw` is held by geometry — nothing read the word "fixed".

  One inert value changes side: `url\9 (` never fetched (whitespace between the ident and `(` is no function token), and normalizing puts a tab where the escape was, which the filter's `\s*` takes. It is pinned as dropped — buying it back would cost a second mechanism for a value that paints nothing.

- 46aee4a: Host fonts become bytes, not just a name.

  Theme extraction learned that the brand font is called "Inter". That name is
  enough for the host's own pages and useless everywhere else: a generated screen
  renders inside surfaces the host's stylesheet never reaches, where "Inter"
  resolves to whatever the surface happens to have — normally nothing.

  - **`vendo sync` now writes `.vendo/fonts.css`** — the theme's families resolved
    to real files and inlined as data-URI `@font-face` rules. Three sources, in
    order of how much each proves about what the host actually ships: next/font's
    build output, the host's own `@font-face` rules pointing under `public/`, then
    the Google Fonts css2 API. The first and last are re-resolved on every run and
    never recorded — next/font's filenames carry a per-build hash and gstatic's
    carry a font version, so a stored path is a path that rots. Written with
    `theme.json` and only then (install, and any sync where the brand actually
    moved), because resolving a face can reach the network and `sync` runs from
    `predev`. `init` prints the one-line import beside the `<VendoProvider>` paste.
  - **`theme.json` gets metadata, never bytes** — `typography.fonts` names each
    face's family/weight/style/source. The file is a bundle import and rides the
    `?vendoTheme=` query string, where a base64 face would blow past every proxy's
    request-line limit.
  - **A host's real mono font is learned instead of discarded.** The body-stack
    derivation found the mono binding, filtered it out of the sans candidates and
    dropped it, so a host shipping Geist Mono still got the generic system stack.
    It is now derived on its own and stored as `typography.monoFamily`, falling
    back to `monospace` rather than `sans-serif` — a code font that fails to load
    must fall back to another code font.
  - **`VendoProvider` takes a `fonts` string** and the chrome injects it beside
    its own sheet, as a guarded `<style data-vendo-fonts>`. Kept separate from
    `ensureChromeStyles` on purpose: the faces and the chrome are wanted
    independently — a surface rendering inside someone else's client needs the
    faces and none of the chrome.

  - **Sync no longer captures its own output.** The root layout now imports
    `.vendo/fonts.css`, and the seed-baseline style capture would have read that
    sheet straight back in — ~65 KB of base64 copied into every remixable seed and
    host-component bundle, on every run. `.vendo/` is sync's output, never host
    source, and the capture skips it.

  Only latin is taken, and only because both sources already publish per-subset
  files. No glyph-subsetting machinery ships, and there is no license logic.

- 83aec51: The Kit gets an `Icon`. Generated screens have had no way to draw a glyph, so
  every affordance has been a word — and the models reach for `lucide-react`
  anyway, which the jail cannot resolve.

  `<Icon name="arrow-up-right"/>` renders an inline stroked SVG that inherits the
  surrounding text's color. 227 names, in lucide's own kebab-case, are extracted
  at build time by `pnpm --filter @vendoai/ui build:icons` into the committed
  `src/kit/icons.gen.ts`; lucide itself is a devDependency, so the runtime carries
  the path data and never the package. A name outside the set renders nothing and
  marks itself `data-kit-missing-icon` — a guessed glyph leaves a gap, never a
  crash and never a broken-glyph box.

- 01e225c: Overlay bricks — Modal, Sheet and Toast — plus the Kit's first stylesheet.

  The three bricks paint outside the screen's own box, on Base UI's Dialog and
  Toast, so the focus trap, Esc and the page's scroll lock come from the library
  rather than from hand-rolled listeners. `KitOverlaySpec` names the open/close
  pair that makes an overlay an overlay, and `KIT_OVERLAY_SPECS` is how a consumer
  routes one without matching on a component name.

  The renderer reads that map: an overlay node paints on the body-level host, so
  its box in the tree generates nothing, and the Stack it was written in no longer
  carries an empty gap where the overlay used to sit.

  `KIT_CSS` is the Kit's first document-level stylesheet, and it carries nothing
  but pseudo-class state — hover, focus-visible and the press, keyed on `data-kit`.
  Everything themable stays inline on the brick. The sheet is injected from the
  tree surface itself, so every generated screen has hover and focus states —
  not only the ones that happen to raise an overlay.

- d9b7c8d: The Kit's `cell` slot generalizes: a component now DECLARES its slots, and the
  checks floor reads that declaration instead of one hard-coded prop name.

  `KitComponentSpec` gains `slots?: Record<string, KitSlotSpec>` — a doc, an
  optional `content` vocabulary and a `perRow` flag per slot — and one table in
  `specs.ts` states every place the Kit takes an element instead of a value:
  `cell` where it already lived (a DataTable column, a CardList field, a KeyValue
  field), `cell` and `marker` on Timeline, and the `content` on a Tabs panel and an
  Accordion section. Every other component declares none, and takes no element at
  all.

  The table states only what the React Kit RENDERS. A slot the components do not
  implement is worse than no slot: the prompt teaches the model to write it, every
  check passes it, and the renderer drops it in silence — the same breakage the
  table exists to refuse, arriving through the table. `@vendoai/ui`'s `test/kit/slot-drift.test.tsx` puts a probe in every
  declared slot and fails unless it finds it in the DOM, so the declaration and
  the implementation move together.

  The `kit-nesting` check reads that table: an element in a declared slot is
  measured against the slot's own vocabulary — the read-only value tier by
  default, so a Button in a per-row `cell` is refused exactly as before — and an
  element under a key no slot declares is refused by name instead of reaching a
  renderer that would drop it. Tabs' and Accordion's element-valued `content`,
  unchecked until now, goes through the same gate. `kitPrompt` prints the slots
  from the same declaration, so the model is taught the table the floor enforces.

  A slot is read at its DECLARED path and nowhere else. Each entry says where it
  sits (`at: "columns"` → `columns[].cell`), and both the prompt and the check use
  that one string — so a `cell` field on a ROW, which a DataTable never looks at,
  is refused by name instead of being admitted as if it were the column's.

  A component sitting in a slot is measured against its OWN spec, not just the
  outer slot's vocabulary. It is a component in its own right: an element in a
  prop it has no slot for, and children under a component that renders none, are
  now refused inside a slot exactly as they are at the top of the tree. Both had
  passed clean while the renderer dropped the descendant.

  The renderer closes the matching gap: an element in a slot resolved only the
  Kit, while the CHILDREN path resolved the Kit and the display bricks, so a brick
  tag written into a slot painted nothing at all. `reifyElement` now reads the
  same two registries `builtinContent` does.

- 5932631: Six static bricks join the Kit, for the shapes a screen could only fake with a
  Stack and a Text: `KeyValue`, `Timeline`, `Avatar`, `CodeBlock`, `EmptyState`
  and `Steps`.

  `<KeyValue record items/>` lays ONE record out as label/value rows — the detail
  a table row expands into — and `<Timeline entries/>` runs a record history down
  a dotted spine. Both take a `cell` slot on the DataTable contract: the slot
  holds an element, the container publishes the record, and the components inside
  name their field. `<Avatar name/>` draws initials in a tint hashed off the name,
  so one person is one color everywhere, and adjacent avatars in a `Row` stack.
  `<CodeBlock code language/>` shows a payload verbatim — no highlighting, no copy
  button. `<EmptyState icon title description>` is the designed nothing-here with
  the action that fixes it nested inside, and `<Steps items active/>` is the
  progress trail, horizontal or vertical.

  Every one is themed through the host's own `--vendo-*` variables and reads the
  new `--vendo-border-width`, `--vendo-mono-family` and `--vendo-color-surface-raised`
  tokens through a fallback, so an unthemed host is unchanged.

- 491a2fa: The whole catalog is in the prompt, so `search_components` is deleted.

  `references/format.md` now carries `catalogPrompt()` instead of `kitPrompt()`:
  one line per component — name, summary, props by class with `!` on the required
  ones, then its slots — plus the 227-name icon vocabulary no prompt has ever
  carried. Measured on this base it costs 13,313 characters against the 20,819 the
  per-brick sections cost for one fewer brick and no icons. A writer that can read
  every component it may use, and every host component by name in its brief, has
  nothing left to search for.

  Removed: the `search_components` tool and its `VENDO_TOOL_TITLES` entry,
  `VendoVerbPorts.searchComponents`, `searchRuntimeCatalog` and
  `CatalogSearchMatch` from `@vendoai/vendo`, and `ScreenSurface.hasComponents` /
  `ScreenAssemblerDeps.hasComponents` — the flag existed only to take the verb off
  the loadout for a deployment with an empty catalog. `VENDO_VERB_TOOLS` is
  `["validate", "schedule"]`.

  Also gone: `catalogThemeSummary` — but only the half of it that duplicated. It
  rendered two things. The host COMPONENT list was a second rendering of what
  `renderBriefingPack` already hands the screen agent, and that half is deleted;
  the pack is now the one and only rendering of that list. The one-line theme
  summary was never a copy of anything — the pack hands the screen agent the theme
  TOKENS verbatim, as JSON, for the rung that renders — so it stays, as
  `themeSummary`, and the `system.catalog` prompt slot is renamed `system.theme`,
  venue-gated exactly as before. A configured theme still reaches the system prompt
  as `Theme: <density> density, <motion> motion, <font> typography.`

- 6856b4f: The wire format (`app.vendo`) and the plan dialect (`plan.vendo`) are gone. One
  artifact writes a screen now — `app.tsx`, a React component through the sealed
  screen engine — so there is one security model, one execution engine and one
  renderer. The tree stays: it is still the JSON currency the renderer paints.

  Removed from `@vendoai/apps/contract`: `compileWire`, `WireCompileOptions`,
  `WireCompileResult`, `expandInlineRefs`, `InlineRefsResult`, `WIRE_ISSUE_CODES`,
  `WIRE_ADVISORY_ISSUE_CODES`, `isAdvisoryWireIssue`, `WireIssue`, `WireIssueCode`,
  `printWire`, `WirePrintInput`, `WirePrintOptions`, `compilePlan`,
  `PlanCompileResult`, `PlanFacts`, `planTabs`, `PLAN_DISPLAYS`, `AppPlan`,
  `PlanDisplay`, `PlanGroup`, `PlanLeaf`, `PlanQuery`, `PlanServer`, and the
  island-derived-values surface. `checkBindingShapes` and `BindingShapeError` stay
  — they moved to `genui/shape-check.ts` and still serve the screen's
  bindings-fit check. `evaluateExpr` and the brace grammar stay: the renderer
  evaluates them.

  Renamed, because "wire" no longer names anything: `KIT_WIRE_UNSAFE_NAMES` is
  `KIT_NON_SCREEN_NAMES` and `KIT_WIRE_COMPONENT_NAMES` is
  `KIT_SCREEN_COMPONENT_NAMES`. The `WIRE_COMPONENT_NAMES` alias is deleted.

  Removed from `@vendoai/apps`: `skeletonFromPlan`, `checkoutApp`,
  `AppsRuntime.authored` (`authoredScreen` is the screen's counterpart and stays),
  `AppsConfig.escalatedPlan`, `create({plan})`, `RenderSeamOptions.authoredApp`,
  `RenderSeamOptions.facts`, `AppFloor.compile` and `AppFloor.check` — the floor
  has one method, `component()`. `HOT_PATH_FILES` is `["app.tsx"]`, so the render
  seam watches, checks and paints exactly one file. `validateWrittenApps` no longer
  takes a `workspace` and no longer has a `{document}` door — a screen's mechanical
  half already ran as its paint gate, so the gate's one call is `validate({appId})`
  — and the `validate` verb itself takes `{ appId }` only.

  Escalation stays and is re-shaped. The screen agent's `escalate` hand takes one
  plain sentence — why assembly cannot serve this ask — and the builder is handed
  the person's ORIGINAL prompt beside it. Nothing pre-plans the build and nothing
  pre-declares the box's interface. The cost is the instant outline: an escalated
  build now shows a plain building state until the box has something real to show.

  Two consequences of the plan's removal, both visible to a host:

  - A box that reported no interface is now a FAILED create/edit rather than a
    warning. It used to be reported only for a plan that required a served
    surface, because a layer-2 failure still left the plan's skeleton standing —
    and there is no skeleton now, so a silent success would be an empty app
    declared ready.
  - The 2→3 served-surface flip has no trigger left. `<Server served>` was its
    only source, so an app can no longer BECOME a served app; everything about one
    that already is (`ui: "http"`) — the serve door, ping, fork refusal, box-path
    edits — is untouched.

- 6856b4f: One venue — the island jail and its apparatus are deleted.

  Model-written code runs in the QuickJS empty room; host-written or human-reviewed code runs native. The double-iframe jail was a third answer, so it goes, and with it its runtime bundle, the ambient island scope, the esm.sh escape hatch, the smoke-render gate and the island syntax gate.

  **Removed from `@vendoai/ui/tree`:** `JailedComponent` and `JailedComponentProps`. The renderer keeps ONE venue: a granted `source: "generated"` node mounts in the host page, an ungranted one drops back to a contained notice. With one venue left, `BoundMode` is gone from `bindValue`/`bindProps`, and the per-island tool manifest and `themeVars` go with the frame that read them.

  **Renamed on `@vendoai/ui/tree`:** `JailFurnishing`, `JailSubSource` and `JailStyle` are `InClientFurnishing`, `InClientSubSource` and `InClientStyle` — minus `packages`, which only ever fed the CDN loader.

  **Removed from `@vendoai/apps/contract`, outright:** `JAIL_PACKAGE_CDN_ORIGIN`, `jailPackageUrl`, `ISLAND_AMBIENT_NAMES`, `ISLAND_AMBIENT_REACT_NAMES`, `ISLAND_AMBIENT_KIT_NAMES`, `ISLAND_AMBIENT_HELPER_NAMES`, `IslandAmbientName`, `ISLAND_STRIPPED_SPECIFIERS`, `ISLAND_RESOLVABLE_SPECIFIERS`, `IslandResolvableModule`, `isStrippedIslandSpecifier`, `IslandImportStrip`, `stripIslandImports`, `blankNonCode`, `islandVendoActionNames`, `islandNetworkViolations` and `islandToolFallbackManifest`.

  **Renamed on `@vendoai/apps/contract`:** `JAIL_ALLOWED_MODULES` is `IN_CLIENT_ALLOWED_MODULES`, `JailModule` is `InClientModule`, `JAIL_BUNDLED_PACKAGES` is `IN_CLIENT_BUNDLED_PACKAGES`, `JailBundledPackage` is `InClientBundledPackage`, and `isPinnedJailPackage` is `isPinnedPackage`. `isIslandResolvableSpecifier`, `scanIslandTools`, `IslandToolScan` and `resolveIslandToolName` stay: `contract/island-ambient.ts` became `contract/screen-tools-scan.ts`, trimmed to the `tools` literal-access scan the tsx door runs and the resolvable-specifier set sync capture asks about. `contract/jail-modules.ts` became `contract/inclient-modules.ts`.

  Two files behind the gate go with it — `server/checking/islands.ts` and `server/checking/smoke-render.ts` — and so do the relocations you should not notice: `jail/viewport-css.ts` to `tree/viewport-css.ts`, `jail/zod-shim.ts` to `tree/inclient-zod-shim.ts` (`JailZodShimError` is `ZodShimError`; both are internal).

  **One fix rides along.** The jail applied `themeVars` from React context, so a generated screen was themed by where its PROVIDER was, not by where its DOM was. With the jail gone, theming rides DOM ancestry — and a bare `<AppFrame>` mounted outside chrome resolved every `--vendo-*` to the empty string and fell back to the porcelain defaults. The surface root is already a boundary, so it declares the theme too, through the same `themeCssVariables()` mapping chrome, the overlay, the approval sheet and the toasts use. Nested in chrome it restates identical values, so there is one mapping and nothing that can disagree.

  `@vendoai/actions` only follows the rename in its closure capture — `CapturedClosure` and `previewBlockingSpecifiers` are unchanged. `@vendoai/mcp` ships its regenerated shim artifact, 4.09 MB down to 3.05 MB.

- 6856b4f: The ✦ gesture collects an instruction, and mints a screen. There are no bare forks: ✦ asks what the person wants BEFORE it fires, and the fork plus that first edit are ONE operation whose output is an ordinary screen app (`app.tsx`, through the ordinary edit door) carrying the remix's provenance — component, baseline, and the instruction, verbatim.

  **Breaking, and it reaches data already on disk.** `AppSeed.instruction` is now REQUIRED (`appSeedSchema`, `@vendoai/core`). A remix seed written before this release does not have one, so its app document fails schema validation and that app will not load. There is no migration in this release. A deployment carrying remixes either backfills `seed.instruction` on those rows with the text the remix was made for, or deletes them and lets people remix again. Apps that were never remixes are untouched.

  Two doors change shape with it, both refusing a call that used to be legal:

  - `seedFrom({ component, slot?, instruction })` — `instruction` is required on `VendoClient.apps.seedFrom` (`@vendoai/ui`) and on `SeedFromInput` (`@vendoai/apps`).
  - `POST /apps/seed` (`@vendoai/vendo`) requires `instruction` in the body and answers `validation` — `instruction must be a non-empty string` — without it.

  Nothing copies the captured host source into the document any more, and nothing evaluates one: `applySeedFork`/`seededBundle` are gone from the generation engine, `seedOnto` from the seed surface, and the wire save's seeded carry-forward from `authoredDocument`. All three were internal. "Is this remix edited?" is one field read now — `doc.source["app.tsx"] !== undefined`.

  A re-seed is RE-IMAGINED rather than kept. When the host ships a new baseline, `reseed` replays the RECORDED INSTRUCTION against it instead of swapping in a pristine copy, so a remix survives its component's redesign as the thing the person asked for. Dedupe per (subject, component) is unchanged, and so is the review lane.

  Three dead ends that used to lie now tell the truth:

  - **A remix still generating is "not ready", not "broken".** Against a real model the first edit takes 9–38s; `open` answered that window with a validation failure, `useApp` spent its three retries in ~900ms, and nothing asked again — the pill sat on "Remixing…" until someone reloaded the page. A seeded app with no screen now answers the same not-found every app gives before its build lands, which the wire's existing build window turns into `{kind:"pending"}`, and `useApp` keeps asking on the embed's cadence until the screen lands or the ONE shared build deadline runs out. A genuinely tree-less app keeps its validation failure. The ✦ badge reads "Remixing…" off the open payload — the same signal the mount below waits on — so the label and the screen change together instead of the label arriving four seconds early.
  - **A fork the build gave up on says so.** A terminal `{kind:"failed"}` lands in the chrome's existing "Didn't load" state, with the server's own reason, instead of reading "Remixed" and "Sandboxed — only you see this" over a page that never got a screen.
  - **A failed remix edit never advances the baseline it did not reach.** `edit()` RETURNS `failedEdit` on its common failure path rather than throwing, and both remix doors read only the throw. A re-seed now replays BEFORE it writes the rebased `seed.baseline`, so a refused replay no longer answers 200 with the old screen and the new baseline. A failed first edit leaves the same terminal `buildFailed` marker a failed build leaves, so `open()` answers with the reason and `list()` skips the row — the next tap mints a fresh app instead of being handed the dead one forever.

- 730ac8f: Theme v2 — nineteen more brand tokens, every one optional.

  `VendoTheme` carried eight colors, two type fields, three radii and two enums.
  Everything the Kit and the chrome needed beyond that was a literal somewhere in
  our source: the green and amber the pills paint, the mono stack, the three
  shadows, the chart ramp, the border width, the chrome's own motion pair. A host
  could not reach any of them. Now it can.

  ```ts
  theme: {
    colors: { …, success: "#0a7d55", warning: "#c98a00", surfaceRaised: "#fafafa" },
    typography: { …, monoFamily: "Berkeley Mono, monospace", weightEmphasis: "650", lineHeightBody: "1.6" },
    shadow: { small: "…", medium: "…", large: "…" },
    borderWidth: "1px",
    chartPalette: ["#1d4ed8", "#0891b2", "#7c3aed"],
    motionDuration: "120ms",
    motionEasing: "cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)",
  }
  ```

  - **Every addition is OPTIONAL.** A theme file that fails to parse is discarded
    whole, so one required field would have blanked the brand of every host whose
    theme predates it. A pre-v2 theme parses and renders exactly as before.
  - **The variable NAMES stay one fixed set — 52 of them.** Three transports
    (the chrome's style object, the MCP door's `style` attribute, the MCP Apps
    shim's `:root{}`) serialize the same mapping and compare their output against
    each other, and the shim's reverse read throws on a name outside the published
    list. So `themeCssVariables` resolves each optional field against a default
    and emits every name for every theme, rather than emitting a name only for
    hosts that set it.
  - **The Kit reads them.** `success`/`warning` stop being Kit-only literals, a
    control's edge is `var(--vendo-border-width)`, and `chartSeries` reads
    `--vendo-chart-1..6` with the accent-derived OKLCH ramp — unchanged — as the
    per-entry fallback. One definition of that ramp now, shared by the emitter and
    the Kit.
  - **Three chrome tokens re-anchor onto the contract.** `--vendo-border` keeps
    the derived ~8% hairline as its DEFAULT but a host that states `colors.border`
    finally wins instead of being ignored; the `--vendo-ok`/`--vendo-warn` family
    reads `colors.success`/`colors.warning`; and `--vendo-duration`/`--vendo-ease`
    derive from the theme's motion pair (the chrome keeps its slower feel through
    a multiplier), so one host knob moves the chrome and generated views together.

  `defaultVendoTheme` is deliberately unchanged: it is the shape the MCP Apps shim
  reconstructs a theme back INTO, and a field the reader cannot recover would make
  a theme round-trip into a different theme. The fill-in values live beside it as
  `themeDefaults`, which the Kit reads for its unthemed fallbacks — so each value
  still has exactly one definition.

### Patch Changes

- 6856b4f: A screen cannot forge the tree it hands back.

  The screen's own code evaluates inside the VM the engine already set up, so every name the engine still reached for AFTERWARDS was the screen's to redefine underneath it. A screen that assigned `JSON.stringify` handed the host a whole tree it never rendered, and the gauntlet passed it.

  The engine now holds the intrinsics it uses after that point — `stringify`, `keys`, `isArray`, `create` — in closure variables taken before the screen's first line. `__vendo` is installed non-writable and frozen, and the module space moved onto it, so `__vendo_modules` and `__vendo_require` are no longer globals and `installSource` freezes the space before the screen runs.

  The emitter reads OWN keys onto a null-prototype object and never emits `__proto__`, `prototype` or `constructor`; the host's `JSON.parse` reviver drops the same three as a second lock. And serialization measures what it is about to hand over — core's `TREE_MAX_NODES`, a depth cap and a size cap — inside the VM, because the host's gate on the other side of `JSON.parse` is one parse too late.

  No API changes. One refusal message changed: the paint budget says it measures UTF-16 code units, which is what `json.length` reads — a CJK-heavy paint could reach ~3x the 512 KiB the sentence used to claim. The node and depth caps bound the tree independently, so the sentence was corrected rather than the check.

### Minor Changes

- c17d492: A parked press gets its answer: the approval modal, the refresh on resolution, and the animated landing.

  A guarded action pressed on a generated screen parked for approval and then
  dead-ended twice over: the ask had no UI anywhere on the page (only a badge
  count), and once someone approved it — over the wire, from the chat card — the
  action ran server-side while the screen sat on "Sending…" and stale numbers
  forever. The resumed call's outcome was simply discarded.

  Now the whole loop closes. The apps runtime persists what became of a parked
  call (`PARKED_CALL_OUTCOME_COLLECTION`, shared with the BYO lane so both write
  the same rows), `GET /approvals/:id` serves it — answering `pending` while the
  resumed call is still running, so the decide window reads as what it is — and
  the screen watches its own parked presses: on `executed` it re-reads its query
  plan and repaints backend truth; on `declined`/`expired` it re-reads too, so a
  screen whose own state latched "sending" re-arms instead of locking forever.

  The ask itself is a centered modal, mounted wherever screens mount (slot, chat
  card, workspace stage, BYO embed, remix): the ask at hero size, Approve/Deny,
  a designed in-flight state for the seconds the decision takes to run, and a
  queue so burst presses ask one question at a time. Esc closes without deciding
  — the pending notice on the pressed control is now pressable and re-raises the
  ask. `ApprovalResolution`'s pending arm may now omit `request` (the decide
  window has no ask left to show); consumers skeleton or fall back.

  Refresh repaints animate: an arriving row opens under a fading highlight, a
  leaving row collapses and returns its gap, and numeric leaves roll to their new
  figure — repaints only, never first paint, never streams, and never under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- c79866f: One idiom for actions — a plain `<Button>` that calls a tool, and the product
  does the asking.

  `<ActionButton>` is removed before it ever shipped. It was a second way to spell
  a write, and the component catalog the manual interpolates
  (`contract/kit/kit-prompt.ts`) already taught the first one — so a model reading
  the manual met two idioms for the same press and had to pick. A screen writes the
  call the way React writes every other event:

  ```tsx
  <Button
    label="Cancel"
    variant="danger"
    onClick={() => tools.cancel_transfer({ id: transfer.id })}
  />
  ```

  Nothing about the press changes: the same `tools` proxy, the same intent, the
  same guard, the same approval modal, the same refresh on success. What the
  element cost was the extra idiom, the ambient declaration that had to be printed
  beside the catalog, and the engine's own component in the VM.

  The confirm rule it carried stays, said plainly instead of attached to one
  component. The manual now states it on the Actions paragraph — destructive and
  money-moving calls are confirmed by the product OUTSIDE the screen, so a screen
  never builds a confirm step of its own — and the reviewer is told the same about
  any control that files its tool call directly: asking twice is the bug, not
  asking once.

### Patch Changes

- 729dd3e: A create that rode its plan to an automation now surfaces the envelope instead of dropping it: `AppsRuntime.create` gains an additive `onServerWork` hook carrying what the server lane produced (the authored automation with its armed state and pending-grant count, arming/flip issues, and the failure sentences when required server work could not be built), and `vendo_make` publishes the same `data-vendo-automation` thread card for a first-ask automation that the edit path has published since Wave 9. Required server work that could not be built rides the receipt's `say` as an honest caveat instead of dying in the server log.
- 9ea21ef: The vendo Cloud gateway's own model family (`vendo`, `vendo-paint`, `vendo-judge`, `vendo-extract`) joins the capability rule that already protected the Claude 5 line: sampling params are dropped and the explicit 64K output cap is set on every call. The family ids are unknown to the stock `@ai-sdk/anthropic` capability registry, which silently clamps unknown models to 4096 max_tokens — a screen agent's generated document truncated mid-wire, nothing painted, no app row landed, and every row-scoped verb (validate, commitSource, schedule) answered not-found. Field-hit on a Cloud-keyed deployment where every escalated build and automation arm failed with "has no row to hold its source".
- 8ded5cc: The automation ask stops falling into the two-step trap. The `schedule` verb's words matched its behavior nowhere: titled "Set when this runs" and described as "Set or change … what you are arming", it taught calling agents to build a view with `vendo_make` and then arm it here — but the verb only re-times an EXISTING automation, so the ask died with a refusal and no automation was ever authored (field: every scheduled-task ask on the linkwarden baseline). Now the verb says the one thing it does — retitled "Change when this runs", described as never creating, naming `vendo_make` (this app in `app`, schedule and action in one request) as the authoring door — and the no-trigger refusal carries the same exact next move so a mid-turn agent can recover. The screen agent's escalate door also names away work explicitly ("any part that must run while nobody is watching — a schedule, a product event — … escalate the WHOLE ask"), closing the gap where its skill taught the `<Server>` declaration but the door's own text listed only real-code reasons to leave, so a schedule ask got assembled as a plain view with no trigger. The MCP app shim is regenerated for the retitle.

### Minor Changes

- d529cf8: The make receipt says `"partial"` when the server work did not get built.

  A create whose server lane failed already told the person the truth in words —
  "I built the screen, but the server-side part didn't get built" — and still
  handed back `status: "ready"`. So the sentence was honest and the FIELD was not:
  everything that branches on `status` rather than reading `say` — a host's own
  `if`, the pack's ref capture, an outside agent over MCP — saw a clean build of a
  half-built app. That is the original silent-success bug one field over.

  `MakeReceipt.status` gains `"partial"`: the screen is painted and on the person's
  page, and the server work its plan required is not. It is deliberately not
  `"failed"`, which means nothing was painted and sends an agent to rebuild — this
  view is real, reopenable, and still narrates through its own card. Hosts that
  switch on `status` should treat `"partial"` as a success with a named gap; hosts
  that only relay `say` are unaffected.

  The tool pack's ref capture refuses it for the same reason it already refuses a
  failed edit: `vendo/app-ref@1` is `{ kind, appId, title, status: "building" }`
  and carries neither `status` nor `say`, so laundering a partial build through it
  left a BYO loop — and `vendo_delegate`'s `refs` — waiting on a completion that
  already came, with no sentence saying what was missing. It now falls back to the
  receipt itself, both fields intact.

- 795f8c1: Screen checking runs where there is no Node — Cloudflare Workers included.

  Checking a component screen means compiling it, type-checking it and RUNNING it,
  and all three used to happen the only way a Node process can: esbuild's native
  binary, the `typescript` package resolved off disk, and a QuickJS build that
  compiles its own WebAssembly at runtime. `createApps` gains a `toolchain` slot
  that holds those three behind one adapter, so a deployment whose checks happen
  where none of them is reachable fills the slot and every other stage runs
  unchanged. Hosts on Node pass nothing and get exactly what they had.

  `@vendoai/apps/edge` is that adapter for a Worker: sucrase instead of esbuild,
  the real TypeScript compiler reading its standard library from string constants
  instead of files, and the screen VM on a `WebAssembly.Module` your deployment
  imported at build time — the one piece a Worker cannot produce for itself.

  ```ts
  import wasmModule from "@jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-sync/wasm";
  import { edgeToolchain } from "@vendoai/apps/edge";

  createApps({ ...config, toolchain: edgeToolchain({ wasmModule }) });
  ```

  Its dependencies are OPTIONAL PEERS, the shape `@vendoai/apps/e2b` already uses:
  a Node host installs none of them and pays for none of them.

  A screen's execution budget can now be counted in INSTRUCTIONS rather than wall
  time (`opsBudget()`). A Workers isolate freezes its clock while your code burns
  CPU, so a time-based deadline gets asked "has the time run out?" a million times
  and truthfully answers "not yet" every time — a runaway screen never stops.
  Counting interrupts does not depend on a clock that moves. Node hosts keep the
  wall-clock budget as the default.

  **Three kinds of screen are now REFUSED that used to pass.** A screen that
  declares a `namespace` block, one that writes a class `static { … }` initializer
  block, and one that relies on sloppy-mode semantics — a write to a frozen object
  being silently dropped, for instance — each come back as a named finding rather
  than a checked screen. All three compile differently depending on what compiled
  them, so a screen resting on one is a screen that works in the venue it was
  checked in and breaks in the next. If your app generates its screens, the next
  revision fixes them; if one was written by hand, the finding names the construct
  and the line.

### Patch Changes

- @vendoai/core@0.16.0

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- b324b79: **Breaking.** Third-party provider keys no longer select adapters. Pass the
  adapter explicitly (`vendo init` now writes it for you) or set `VENDO_API_KEY`.

  Env keys are credentials; config selects. A key lying around in the environment
  used to choose which sandbox a deployment ran on, which provider it billed, and
  which account every app machine's inference went to — decided by nothing anyone
  wrote down. `VENDO_API_KEY` is now the only environment variable that fills an
  adapter slot you left unset. Every ladder reads the same way: explicit config,
  then `VENDO_API_KEY`, then an honest failure that names both ways out.

  - **Sandbox.** `E2B_API_KEY` no longer selects the e2b venue. It is the
    credential an explicit `sandbox: e2bSandbox()` reads when you pass no inline
    `apiKey`, and `e2bSandbox()` now refuses at boot — rather than at the first
    box build — when the optional `e2b` package does not resolve from the project.
    An unset `sandbox` slot composes the Cloud sandbox with `VENDO_API_KEY`, or
    nothing. `selectSandbox` drops its e2b rung and its `e2bSpecifier` parameter;
    the `"e2b"` venue string stays in the `/status` union for older wires, but an
    explicit adapter reports `"custom"` like any other.
  - **Agent model.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` /
    `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` select nothing. They are read by the
    `@ai-sdk/*` provider you construct and pass in `models`. With no `models` and
    no `VENDO_API_KEY`, the first turn says exactly that instead of quietly riding
    a key you set for something else.
  - **Box inference.** The `VENDO_INFERENCE_URL` + `VENDO_INFERENCE_KEY` pair wins
    as a pair — both halves or neither — then `VENDO_API_KEY` rides the Cloud
    gateway, then the box gets no inference door. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` rung is
    gone from both `boxInference()` and the Claude Code harness's
    `inferenceEnv()`: a provider key in the deployment's environment used to point
    every box at `api.anthropic.com` and bill that account.
  - **Doctor.** `E-LIVE-007` is retired — with no key-selected venue there is no
    such thing as a venue the operator did not ask for, and the boot refusal is
    earlier and louder than a probe. The code stays in the append-only registry
    and keeps its verify-page anchor. `E-LIVE-004` now names the two ways out.

  `VENDO_DEV_CREDENTIAL` still pins a credential rung, and is now the only way to
  reach an `env-key` rung at all — but it is internal, Vendo's own E2E rung matrix
  and escape hatch, not a host knob, and it can change without notice. Your app's
  model belongs in `models`.

### Patch Changes

- 9e0ed9a: Vendo's own drawers are reached by name, not through the generic records door.

  Every internal collection `@vendoai/apps` owns — app rows, app grants,
  placements and their slot pointers, app tokens, the slot registry, the capped
  version log, the parked egress and action cards, in-client approvals, remix
  rejections — now goes through the store's named `engine` family
  (`ops.engine.get/put/delete/list/claim/insertIfAbsent/compareAndSwap`) instead
  of `store.records(<collection>)`. Same collection, same verb, same arguments,
  same order; `assertEngineCollection` gates the name on every one of them, so a
  drawer this block has no business in cannot be reached from here at all.

  The one dynamic collection name is composed by core's `engineAppHistory(appId)`
  builder rather than assembled at a call site, so a name that could not pass the
  gate is never built in the first place.

  Two consequences worth naming. The placement store drops its no-atomic
  fallbacks: `claim`, `insertIfAbsent` and `compareAndSwap` are contract on every
  engine verb set, so the read-then-write concession a BYO adapter used to get has
  nothing left to concede, and the slot arbitration is now always one decision.
  And a store that offers neither its own ops surface nor a SQL handle refuses at
  the first app-row operation with `not-implemented` naming what to configure,
  rather than silently persisting through an ungated façade.

  Generated-app data is unaffected: it belongs to the `appData` family, which
  stamps an owner, and `vendo_state` stays on the store façade.

### Patch Changes

- 0d67885: The byApp erase cascade reaches two app drawers it never could.

  Two classes of row survived the app they belonged to, permanently, and both
  were invisible for the same reason: the cascade's selectors and the writers'
  row shapes were decided in different files and never compared.

  **The ref key.** In-client approvals (`vendo_inclient_approvals`) and remix
  rejections (`vendo_remix_rejections`) wrote their app reference as
  `refs.appId`. The cascade's byApp leg matches `refs @> {"app_id": …}` — the
  spelling every other writer in the repo uses (app tokens, placements, app data,
  armed automations, sponsorships, grants). Camel-cased, the containment check
  simply never matched, so an approval to mount an app in the host page outlived
  the app it approved. Both writers now spell `app_id`, and
  `backfillAppRefKey(store)` renames the key on rows already on disk: it touches
  `refs` and nothing else, deletes nothing, and is re-runnable by construction —
  a second run reports `rowsRenamed: 0`.

  **The version log.** `vendo:app-history:<id>` holds every stored version of an
  app plus its pin-intent trail. The byApp cascade reached generic rows two ways —
  an `app:<id>:` collection prefix, or refs containment — and app history
  satisfies neither: its name uses a different prefix, and its rows carry no refs
  at all. Every version of every deleted app was still in the table. The cascade
  now names the collection directly, through core's `engineAppHistory` builder —
  the same one the write side composes it with, so the two cannot drift — and it
  sits in the shared app-scoped step, so the bySubject leg sweeps it too.

  `createInClientApprovals` and `createAppHistory` are now exported from
  `@vendoai/apps`, so `@vendoai/store` can prove the cascade against the real
  writers rather than a hand-rolled copy of the rows they produce.

  - @vendoai/core@0.12.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- eeebbee: The agent's data tools move onto `appData` — one user can no longer see another's rows.

  `vendo_apps_data_list` / `_put` / `_delete` are how the embedded agent saves and
  reads an app's declared storage on the person's behalf. They landed in the
  generic `records` family, which has no answer to "whose row is this": every
  user of an app wrote into one flat collection, and the only thing between them
  was that nobody had asked.

  Now every one of those calls carries `ctx.principal.subject` — the LIVE caller,
  off the run context, never off the tool args — into the owner-stamped `appData`
  family. `put` stamps the row with that subject, `list` ANDs it into the query,
  `get` answers `null` for another owner's row and `delete` no-ops on one. A
  cross-user read is no longer forbidden; it is unexpressible. An id another owner
  already holds refuses with `conflict` rather than being taken over, and that
  refusal is surfaced honestly rather than swallowed. Declared file collections
  get the same treatment through the family's file twins.

  Nothing about what an app may declare changed. The guards keep their posts in
  the same order — the declaration check (with `state` still reserved), the
  declared-refs check, the 256 KB record cap, the 5 MB blob cap — and app state
  (`vendo_state`) stays on the `StoreAdapter` façade, deliberately.

  `AppsConfig` gains an optional `ops` slot that the umbrella fills with the same
  `StoreOps` surface the deployment already selected. Its absence is a real
  answer, not a failure: a store that offers neither its own ops nor a SQL handle
  keeps exactly today's behavior instead of crashing composition at boot.

- a216b68: Box rows are owner-stamped, and the box still never learns who the user is.

  `PUT $VENDO_STORE_URL/rows/<collection>/<id>` used to land in the generic
  records family, where every row an app wrote was one drawer per app and nothing
  more. It now lands in the `appData` family, so the door stamps each row with the
  subject of the app token that presented it: one user's rows are the only rows
  that user's requests can read, list, overwrite or delete. Cross-user access is
  unwritable rather than merely forbidden — an id another user holds comes back
  `409 conflict`, and a caller who tries to name an owner by sending
  `refs.subject` is refused `400 validation`.

  Nothing about this crosses the sandbox boundary. The box is told no identity and
  takes no owner parameter; the door stamps on its behalf, which is why the client
  below has no owner argument to get wrong.

  The HTTP contract is unchanged, byte for byte. Existing rows keep their
  collection names (`app:<id>:box:<collection>`), and the `appData` backfill gives
  rows written before the flip their owner stamp.

  **`./rows.js` in the box template** — a zero-dependency client for the door,
  which the in-box coding agent is now pointed at first and the raw curl second:

  ```js
  import { rows } from "./rows.js";

  const notes = rows("notes");
  await notes.put("note_1", { title: "Hello" }); // → the stored record
  await notes.get("note_1"); // → the record, or null
  await notes.list({ limit: 20 }); // → { records, cursor? }
  await notes.delete("note_1");
  ```

  It is the app's server half only — it reads `$VENDO_APP_TOKEN`, and `fns.js` is
  the only place that may. A failure throws an `Error` carrying `.code` and
  `.status`, so a caller branches on `error.code === "conflict"` instead of
  parsing prose.

  A deployment whose store offers neither a SQL handle nor a `StoreOps` surface
  now refuses THAT REQUEST on the rows door, naming both ways to give it one,
  rather than writing rows nobody owns.

### Patch Changes

- 402e7ad: A remix survives its own edit door. Three defects, all of which destroy work a
  person can see on screen, all of which returned 200.

  **The island gate no longer runs over a seeded seat.** Its rules are the
  GENERATED-island contract — no imports, ambient Kit only, no hand-typed constant
  feeding displayed math — and captured host source cannot satisfy them by
  construction (the demo host's own capture blocks on `pad = 6`, SVG chart
  padding). `seed.from` writes its row without the floor, so the document was born
  un-admittable: the next edit ran the floor, got the unsatisfiable blocks back
  verbatim as repair instructions, and the only edit that cleared them was to stop
  rendering the island. The person's fork was replaced by plain host components,
  the bundle orphaned and the app renamed, while the card still rendered and the
  ✦ pill still said "Remixed". A capture with no default export is still refused,
  by the seed doors themselves, where it always was.

  **A fork records the version that says where it came from.** `seed.from` is the
  one create that does not go through `persistEdit`, so it now appends its own
  history entry. Without it a remix arrived with no history at all — and a
  review-kind remix failed closed to pending the moment its current version
  stopped being approved, because the reviewer's serve path reads the newest
  approved snapshot out of history.

  **A file save no longer deletes a legacy remix's source.** The save's
  seeded-bundle carry-forward was keyed on `origin === "seeded"`, but a component
  entry may be a bare source string — the shape every remix forked before the
  seeded bundle existed is stored in — and those read back as `authored`, so the
  carry never fired and a save that omitted the component dropped the remix
  outright.

  All three now key on the component's NAME (`isSeedComponentName`). The origin
  cannot carry this: a compiled `app.vendo` prints its components as bare source
  strings, so an origin test reads `authored` on exactly the path that matters.

### Minor Changes

- e2128aa: App generation moves into one package, behind two doors

  `@vendoai/apps` now has a browser-safe **contract door** and a node-only
  **engine root**. The app format — the document, the two genui dialects and their
  compilers, the Kit, the island/jail rules, catalog + theme, the checking
  contract, remix provenance, and the wire shapes `/apps/*` returns — lives on
  `@vendoai/apps/contract`, which imports no node built-ins. The behavior that
  produces those shapes stays behind `@vendoai/apps`.

  **Migration:**

  1. **Moved `@vendoai/core` names are a hard rename** — import them from
     **`@vendoai/apps/contract`**: the genui dialect (`validateTree`, `compileWire`,
     `compilePlan`, `printWire`, the expression grammar), the Kit, the
     island/jail rules, catalog + theme, `AppFloor`/`Check`/`CheckInput`,
     `ScreenAssembler`, `MakeReceipt`, host components, and build deadlines.
     Types reaching you through `@vendoai/vendo` or the `vendoai` alias are
     **unchanged** — the umbrella re-exports the contract beside core.
     `@vendoai/apps` is ESM-only, so `require()` of these _values_ needs ESM or
     the umbrella.
     `AppDocument` and its schemas, and `Finding`, deliberately **stay in
     `@vendoai/core`** (the store contract and the harness runtime speak them);
     the contract door re-exports them, so one door serves every consumer.

  2. **Subpaths — what moved and what did not.** Entry points go 8 → 4:

     - **`@vendoai/apps`, `@vendoai/apps/e2b` and `@vendoai/apps/testing` all
       survive with their specifiers unchanged.** `./e2b` stays because the venue
       ladder reaches it as a real module seam, not merely a convenience re-export.
     - `@vendoai/apps/{sandbox-ladder,internal}` **fold into `@vendoai/apps`** —
       import those names from the root.
     - `@vendoai/apps/adapter-conformance` → **`@vendoai/apps/testing`**, not the
       root: it imports `vitest`, and the root rides every composed host's server
       path.
     - `@vendoai/apps/claude-turn` → **`@vendoai/harnesses/claude-turn`** and
       `@vendoai/apps/box-door` → **`@vendoai/harnesses/box-door`** (both moved with
       `claudeCode()`).
     - **NEW:** `@vendoai/apps/contract`.

  3. **`@vendoai/ui`, `@vendoai/store`, `@vendoai/actions` and `@vendoai/mcp` now
     depend on `@vendoai/apps`** and read the app format from
     `@vendoai/apps/contract`. Their own public surfaces are unchanged.

  **Known tradeoffs, stated plainly:**

  - **One name, still two declarations.** `@vendoai/ui` no longer keeps its own
    copy of the `/apps/*` wire shapes — it re-exports them from the contract
    door. That removes a copy; it does not yet make one definition. The engine's
    server door declares its own richer `EditResult` (with `failure`,
    `graduated`, `box`, `pendingEgress`, `automation`) beside the contract's
    four-field wire shape, so the name has two declarations inside
    `@vendoai/apps`, one per door. Unifying them decides which fields the wire
    may expose, which is a behavior change and not part of this move.
  - **Install weight.** `@vendoai/apps` declares `esbuild`, `jsdom`, `fflate` and
    `react-dom` as hard dependencies, so a browser-only consumer of
    `@vendoai/apps/contract` still installs the engine's dependency set. The
    contract door itself bundles clean for a browser target (enforced by a new
    leg in `scripts/portability-gate.mjs`); it is the install graph, not the
    bundle, that carries the weight. Pre-existing, amplified by this split.

- e1032f9: The package now exports only what its consumers actually import. Two runtime
  doors and twelve names left the public surface; nothing in this repo, the
  console, or the examples called any of them.

  Gone from `AppsRuntime`: `machine.editApp` (and its `MachineEditResult` result
  type) and `prewarm`. `machine.editApp` had zero callers — the in-box edit path
  every caller actually uses is `edit`, which graduates the app and lands the
  tree's `fn:` bindings as well as the server change. `prewarm` was a best-effort
  page-open model warm-up no surface ever mounted.

  Gone from the package root: `placementStore`, `PLACEMENTS_COLLECTION`,
  `parseVendoManifest`, `vendoManifestSchema`, `detectPinDrift`,
  `inClientApprovalSchema`, `remixRejectionSchema`, `appMountFor`,
  `invalidSourcePath`, and `buildFailureReason`. Every one of them is still used
  inside the package — only the re-export is gone. The types beside them stay
  exported, as do `checkoutApp`, `commitApp`, `appVersionHash`,
  `pinComponentName`, `pinBaselineSchema`, `planAutomation`, and
  `skeletonFromPlan`, which real consumers import.

  `@vendoai/apps/claude-turn` no longer exports the `ClaudeSessionInput` and
  `SdkModule` interfaces; `createClaudeSession` and `ClaudeSession` are unchanged.

- 079d7d8: Four unreachable features leave the public surface. Nothing in this repo, the
  console, or the examples called any of them; every name was re-grepped across
  `packages/`, `examples/`, `fixtures/`, `corpus/` and `scripts/` before removal.

  **The secrets-exposure write path (ENG-345) is gone.** `AppsRuntime.secrets` —
  both `exposure()` and `setExposure()` — is deleted, along with the
  `vendo_secret_exposure` grant store, the `SecretExposureState` and
  `SetExposureResult` types, and the synthetic `vendo_secret_expose` approval
  descriptor. This was the exception path that placed a secret's REAL value into a
  box. The default is unchanged and is now the only behavior: a declared secret
  enters the sandbox as an opaque alias and is substituted at the egress proxy.
  The egress half of the approval flow (`vendo_egress_allow`) rides the same
  `onApprovalDecision` subscription and is untouched, as are `redaction.ts` and
  `egress-approval.ts`. `buildEnv` keeps its optional `grants` argument, so a host
  that assembles box env itself needs no change.

  **Five manual machine-lifecycle doors are gone**: `machine.provision`, `wake`,
  `sleep`, `destroy` and `syncManifest`. Each duplicated work the runtime already
  does on its own — graduation provisions, box edits and fn calls wake, edits
  sleep, `apps.delete` reaps, and manifest schedules fold in automatically after
  every box edit. `machine.available`, `machine.ping` and `machine.report` stay,
  and the whole internal lifecycle is unchanged.

  **Two bypassed trust-check doors are gone**: `inClient.verdict` and
  `inClient.approvals`. The verdict clients actually read rides the `open()`
  payload as `inClient`; `inClient.shipDiff`, `inClient.approve`, the dev approve
  route and all internal verdict logic are unchanged.

  **`pins.drift` is gone.** The live drift path is the report `open()` attaches to
  the payload, which is unchanged; `detectPinDrift` and its internal callers stay,
  as do `pins.fork` and `pins.rebase`.

- 0e51585: `AppMachine.envStaleAt` — the Wave-7 env-rebuild marker — and the wake-time
  rebuild it gated are removed.

  The marker's only production writer was the secrets-exposure grant flow deleted
  in #1100, so nothing could set it any more and `rebuildStaleEnv` could never
  run. What goes with it:

  - `AppMachine.envStaleAt` (`@vendoai/core`) — field and schema entry
  - `rebuildStaleEnv` and both of its wake call sites (`machine-lifecycle.ts`)
  - the `injectEnv` slot on `MachineLifecycleConfig`, whose only reader it was,
    and the `injectEnv: pushBoxEnv` wiring in `box-lane.ts`
  - `nextEnvStaleAt` (`persistence.ts`), which already had zero callers

  The two paths that assemble and inject a box's boundary env are untouched:
  provision (`buildEnv` → `SandboxAdapter.create`) and the pre-edit re-injection
  every box edit makes (`buildAppEnv` → `pushBoxEnv` over the box control port).
  `pushBoxEnv` itself stays — the edit path is its live caller.

  The machine schema is `.passthrough()`, so a stored document that still carries
  an `envStaleAt` key parses exactly as before; the key survives as an unknown
  field and is simply no longer typed, validated, or read.

- e87a765: Three v1 back-compat readers leave the runtime. A production-data audit across
  all 84 Cloud tenant schemas and the console mirror (898 app documents) found
  ZERO rows carrying any of the three shapes, and every name was re-grepped across
  `packages/`, `examples/`, `fixtures/`, `corpus/` and `scripts/` before removal.

  **The e2b v1 snapshot-ref decoder is gone.** `decodeSnapshotRef` accepts only
  `e2b:v2:` refs now; the `e2b:v1:` prefix, its `egress` → `allowedDomains`
  mapping, and its mention in the validation error are deleted.

  > **BREAKING for self-hosted deployments:** pre-v2 e2b snapshot refs are no
  > longer resumable; re-create the app's box.

  Nothing else about the v2 path changes — the ref format, the `sourceSandboxId`
  reap-on-destroy, the port and allowlist round-trip are all untouched.

  **The retired v1 `server` field readers are gone.** `rungFor` no longer consults
  `app.server`, the fork no longer strips it, and interchange no longer lists or
  omits it — the field is dropped from `APP_DOCUMENT_FIELDS`, so a document that
  smuggles one is stripped by the allowlist exactly as any other unknown field is.
  Rung 4 stays: it is a served document with no machine (a de-graduated doc), which
  is still reachable and still has no surface. The singular `trigger` → `triggers`
  import migration beside it is UNTOUCHED — production documents still carry the
  singular key, and that migration is alive.

  **The legacy scheduler-state migration is gone.** The `vendo_app_schedules`
  cache, the `carryLegacyCursors` cutover that carried its `lastFiredAt` onto the
  new per-trigger cursor, and `clearLegacyState` (with its one caller in
  `apps.delete`) are deleted. The apps-side write into the automations-owned
  `automations:schedule` collection existed solely for that cutover and goes with
  it, as its own comment said it would. The successor cursor path in
  `@vendoai/automations` — the one the engine actually reads and writes — is
  untouched.

- 361f9b9: The app format has one definition, and a test that fails when a mirror drifts

  The format was kept by hand in four places — the contract, core's pinned limits,
  the manual the agent reads, and the public docs — and they disagreed. The manual
  promised "16 islands, 64 KB each" and never mentioned the **256 KB total** the
  validator also enforces, so a build that obeyed the manual could exceed a budget
  it was never told about and fail to validate for a reason it could not see.
  Nothing about enforcement changed; the manual and the docs are now generated
  from, and pinned to, the same constants.

  **A generated component may now be a bundle, and nothing migrates.**
  `AppDocument.components` values widen from `string` to `ComponentEntry` —
  either the legacy bare source string or a `ComponentBundle`
  (`{ source, modules?, styles?, sampleProps?, origin: "authored" | "seeded" }`).
  Backward compatible **by construction**: a stored bare string still reads, and
  every reader goes through `bundleOf(entry)`, which returns
  `{ source, origin: "authored" }` for one. No document is rewritten, no version
  is minted, and an app stored before this release opens unchanged.

  _If you read `document.components` yourself_, that is the one change to make:

  ```ts
  // before
  const source = document.components?.[name];
  // after
  import { bundleOf, componentSources } from "@vendoai/apps/contract";
  const source = bundleOf(document.components?.[name] ?? "").source;
  const asSources = componentSources(document.components); // the whole map
  ```

  `ComponentBundle`, `componentBundleSchema`, `ComponentEntry`,
  `componentEntrySchema` and `bundleOf` are **declared in `@vendoai/core`**, beside
  the `AppDocument` field they type — core's store conformance kit parses a stored
  row with `appDocumentSchema` and cannot reach up into `@vendoai/apps`. The
  contract door **re-exports** them and never re-declares them, so
  `@vendoai/apps/contract` remains the one place to import the format from. Same
  rule as `TREE_MAX_GENERATED_COMPONENTS` / `TREE_MAX_COMPONENT_SOURCE_BYTES` /
  `TREE_MAX_TOTAL_COMPONENT_BYTES`, which are re-exported from core here too.

  **BREAKING — the plan dialect loses two leaf fields.** `PlanLeaf` no longer has
  `query` or `attrs`, and `<Leaf>` no longer parses a `query` attribute or
  collects arrangement hints. Both were parsed and fact-checked with no downstream
  consumer. A `<Leaf query="…" col="2"/>` still compiles — the extra attributes are
  simply ignored — so no plan text breaks; only code reading `leaf.query` or
  `leaf.attrs` does. The plan's top-level `<Query>` list and `<Cannot>` are
  unaffected.

  **New on `@vendoai/apps/contract`: the real validator surface.** `componentMapError`
  and `utf8ByteLength` (the generated-component map rules, measured in UTF-8 bytes),
  `SAFE_COMPONENT_NAME`, and `componentSources`. A consumer validating a component
  map should call `componentMapError` rather than re-implementing the byte
  accounting and the reserved-name check against `KIT_COMPONENT_NAMES`.

  **The Kit vocabulary is one list.** `KIT_COMPONENT_NAMES` derives from `KIT_SPECS`,
  `kitComponentNames()` returns that list instead of recomputing it, and
  `WIRE_COMPONENT_NAMES` is `KIT_WIRE_COMPONENT_NAMES` re-exported — the same
  binding, not a second array. All three names are still exported and their values
  are unchanged.

- b0a165c: Remix is a seeded app: the pins subsystem is gone

  An app that was made from one of your components no longer carries a list of
  "pins". It carries a single `seed` — the component it started from and the
  version of that component it started at. A remix is an ordinary app that
  happens to start from something, so it is created, validated, edited and
  versioned through exactly the same doors as every other app.

  **Behaviour change you will notice: updating a remix now replaces it.**
  When the host component changes, the remix reports drift as a warning and
  nothing happens on its own. If you choose to update, you get the pristine new
  component — the edits you made to that component are replaced. The previous
  release replayed your recorded edits on top of the new version; that machinery,
  its preflight and the version trail feeding it are deleted. Drift is a warning,
  and updating is always your choice. The UI says this in the drift banner, and
  the agent tool's description tells the model to say it too.

  **Behaviour change on admission.** Every write path now runs the same document
  validation, seeded and forked apps included. Seeded bundles used to skip the
  island gate entirely, so a capture the jail could never render was accepted
  without complaint. Captures that produce invalid documents will now be refused.

  **Fixed.** A seeded app whose host component had moved on used to open with no
  imports, no sub-modules and no styles — silently. Those furnishings were
  hash-matched against the live baseline at open time, so any drift lost them.
  They now travel inside the stored component bundle. Separately, artifact export
  dropped remix provenance because the interchange field whitelist never listed
  it, so export-permission checks never ran.

  **Renames.**

  - `AppDocument.pins?: Pin[]` → `AppDocument.seed?: AppSeed`
    (`{ component, baseline, slot?, review? }`). `Pin` and `pinSchema` are removed;
    `AppSeed` and `appSeedSchema` replace them. `forkedFrom` is unchanged.
  - `AppsRuntime.pins.{fork,rebase}` → `AppsRuntime.seed.{from,reseed}`, plus
    `seed.drift`. `seed.from({ component, slot?, instruction? })` and
    `seed.reseed({ appId })` both return the `AppDocument`.
  - `pinComponentName` → `seedComponentName`; `PinBaseline`/`pinBaselineSchema` →
    `SeedBaseline`/`seedBaselineSchema`; `AppsConfig.pinBaselines` →
    `seedBaselines`; `detectPinDrift` → `seedDrift` (one seed, so it returns one
    `SeedDrift` or `null`); `ScreenPinDrift` → `ScreenSeedDrift`.
  - `EditResult.driftedPins?: PinDrift[]` → `EditResult.seedDrift?: SeedDrift`;
    the tree payload's `pinDrift` array → a single `seedDrift`.
  - HTTP: `POST /apps/fork-pin` and `POST /apps/:id/fork-pin` → `POST /apps/seed`;
    `POST /apps/:id/rebase-pin` → `POST /apps/:id/reseed`.
  - Client: `apps.forkPin(...)` → `apps.seedFrom({ component, slot?, instruction? })`;
    `apps.rebasePin(id, slot)` → `apps.reseed(id)`.
  - Agent tool `vendo_apps_rebase_pin` (appId + slot) → `vendo_apps_reseed` (appId).
  - `@vendoai/actions` no longer declares its own `CapturedPinBaseline`; the one
    shape lives on `@vendoai/apps/contract` and actions re-exports it as
    `SeedBaseline` / `seedBaselineSchema`.
  - `PinForkInput`, `PinForkResult`, `PinRebaseResult` and `PinDrift` are removed.

  Seeding into an app that already exists is gone: the gesture always mints an
  app, because a seed is the provenance of a whole app rather than a row added to
  one. The generated component name stored inside documents is deliberately
  unchanged, so apps already on disk keep working.

- 1549f90: The published surface shrinks to what consumers actually import.

  **`@vendoai/apps/testing` exports three names**, down from 32:
  `inMemoryBoxFiles`, `scriptedLanguageModel` and `ScriptedModelCall` — the ones
  imported outside this package. The other 29 fixtures (the sandbox fakes, the
  guard and store doubles, the assemblers, the row seeds) are this package's own;
  they still exist, and this package's tests now name the module they come from
  instead of the published barrel.

  **Eleven free-floating type exports leave the package root.** Each was reachable
  from no public value, schema, `AppsRuntime` method or `AppsConfig` field, and
  had no importer anywhere: `ManifestTriggerResult`, `ManifestTriggerSync`,
  `VendoManifest`, `VendoManifestSchedule`, `PlacementRow`, `PlacementStore`,
  `GeneratedAppDocument`, `CheckingLayer`, and the `Check`, `CheckInput` and
  `Finding` re-exports — those three are `@vendoai/core`'s types, and a host
  writing an `AppsConfig.checks` entry imports them from core, where a pack is
  authorable without depending on this block.

  Everything anchored to surviving surface stays exported, including
  `AuthoredAppResult`, `EditFailure`, `BuildEnvContext`, `BuiltBoxEnv`,
  `InferenceResolver`, `AppMachineStatus`, `PublishRecord`, `ShareSnapshot`,
  `ReviewStanding`, `RemixRejection`, `ReviewQueueEntry`, `ShipDiffPin`,
  `ShipDiffGenerated`, `Skeleton`, `AutomationPlan`, `GenerationDependencies`,
  `PlacementEntry`, `PinForkInput` and `PinForkResult`.

- 79d7088: Three shapes the apps runtime produces and the client consumes now have exactly
  one definition, in core.

  `@vendoai/ui` may not import `@vendoai/apps` (the dependency guard's layering
  rule), so it re-declared the wire shapes it reads "verbatim from the frozen
  contract text". That is a promise, not a mechanism. `pinComponentName` — the
  generated-component name a forked host slot ships under, and therefore the name
  the client's in-place mount looks the node up by — existed as THREE hand-written
  copies: `apps/pins.ts`, ui's `<Remixable>` wrapper, and ui's wire fixture.

  Moved into `@vendoai/core`:

  - `pinComponentName` → `core/app-document.ts`, beside `Pin` (it is a pure
    function of `Pin.slot`).
  - `PlacementEntry` and `ReviewStanding` → `core/app-surfaces.ts`, a new module
    whose membership rule is one line: apps produces it, ui consumes it off the
    wire.

  No package's public surface changes. `@vendoai/apps` still exports
  `pinComponentName`, `PlacementEntry` and `ReviewStanding` from the same modules
  as before, and `@vendoai/ui` still exports `PlacementEntry` and `ReviewStanding`
  from its root — each is now a re-export of core's single definition.

  `PinForkResult` was deliberately NOT unified. Its own fields match on both
  sides, but its `edit?: EditResult` does not: apps' `EditResult` carries
  `failure`, `graduated`, `box` and `pendingEgress`, which ui's copy never grew,
  and the wire returns the runtime's result untrimmed. Unifying it would widen
  `@vendoai/ui`'s published `EditResult` — a contract change, not a refactor.

- 79d7088: The per-person app-sharing chain — the Share dialog and everything under it —
  is removed. No host ever mounted the dialog; every name below was re-grepped
  across `packages/`, `examples/`, `fixtures/`, `corpus/`, `scripts/`,
  `docs-site/` and the console repo before removal, and the only callers found
  were other members of this same chain.

  **Gone from `@vendoai/ui`:** the `ShareDialog` component and `ShareDialogProps`
  (from `@vendoai/ui/chrome`), the `useAppGrants` hook, and the five client
  methods that existed only to feed them — `client.apps.grants`, `.share`,
  `.unshare`, `.promote` and `.resolvePerson`. `ForkOffer` and
  `encodeGrantPrincipal` shared the dialog's file and are unaffected; the file is
  now `chrome/fork-offer.tsx`.

  **Gone from `@vendoai/vendo`:** the wire routes `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE
/apps/:id/grants`, `POST /apps/:id/grants/resolve` and `POST /apps/:id/promote`,
  their handlers, and the `promoteApp` composition seam.

  **Gone from `@vendoai/apps`:** `AppsRuntime.promote`, and the write half of
  `AppsRuntime.access` — `list`, `grant`, `revoke` and `holder`. Their now
  unreachable supporting seams go with them: `AppsConfig.multiParty`,
  `AppsConfig.promoteApp`, and the internal `requireMultiParty` / `requireAccess`
  / `reportShare` helpers.

  **Unchanged, and deliberately so:**

  - `AppsRuntime.access.levelFor`, and `access-checks.ts`' `holds` / `owned` /
    `requireOwned` / `grantedRecords` — the permission backbone behind every app
    door.
  - The `AppAccess` seam itself (`@vendoai/store`'s `appAccess(store)`), whose
    full `levelFor`/`grant`/`revoke`/`list`/`can` surface and conformance kit are
    untouched. Grant rows are still written and read there; only the runtime door
    over that write half is gone.
  - `vendo.apps.share()` and `vendo.apps.publish()` — the Cloud snapshot and
    registry feature. A different feature that merely shares a name with the
    deleted grants `share`.
  - The auth presets' `resolvePerson` seam and `/status`'s `namesPeople` flag.
  - `@vendoai/store`'s `appStore().promote` row primitive and the hosted store's
    `lifecycle.promote` op.

- 0f46e44: Dead features and their public surface are gone. Every removal below had zero
  callers in this repo, the console, or the examples; nothing changed behavior for
  a caller that was using a live path.

  **`@vendoai/core` (breaking).** `AppDocument.placements` is gone from the
  interface and the schema, and the validator no longer checks it. There has been
  no writer since the placements-as-rows split; "show this app in that slot" is a
  placement ROW (`@vendoai/apps` `placements.ts`, `GET /apps/placements`), which
  is unchanged and is the live feature. Also removed: `PlanIsland` and the
  `AppPlan.island` field, because the plan-level `<Island name purpose/>`
  declaration no longer parses; and `PackSkill`, the deprecated alias for `Skill`.
  `Pin`, `pinSchema` and `AppDocument.pins` are untouched — fork provenance is
  still live.

  **`@vendoai/apps` (breaking).** `PinShipRequest`, `PinApproval`,
  `pinShipRequestSchema` and `pinApprovalSchema` never ran; `ShipDiffPin` and
  `inClientApprovalSchema` are the live path and stay. `bindingKindCheck` is gone
  — it had no callers; the `bindingKindIssues` walker it wrapped is still used by
  the validate path. The plan compiler no longer accepts a plan-level
  `<Island name purpose/>` element (an inline `<Island>` inside an app file is a
  different, live feature and is unchanged). `GenerationPromptSection["id"]`
  narrows to `"theme" | "design-rules"`; the other five ids had no producer.

  **`@vendoai/store` (breaking).** The `stateStore` and `approvalStore` helpers
  are gone. Both were test-only wrappers over the routed `records("vendo_state")`
  and approval write paths, which are unchanged and are what production uses.
  `ApprovalRow` is unaffected — it is exported from `helpers/types.ts` as before.

  **`@vendoai/agents` (breaking).** The `./harnesses` subpath export is gone.
  Import the harness factories from their own package instead:
  `import { claudeCode } from "@vendoai/harnesses/claude-code"` and
  `import { vendo } from "@vendoai/harnesses"`.

  **`@vendoai/knowledge`.** `knowledgeIndexSummary` and `parseKnowledgeConfig` are
  no longer exported from the package root. Both functions stay and are still used
  internally by `knowledgeIndexResolver`, which remains exported.

  **`@vendoai/actions`.** `DEFAULT_CAPTURE_BUDGET_BYTES` is no longer exported.
  The constant and the 256 KB default it sets are unchanged.

  **`@vendoai/ui`.** The unexported, unreferenced `TakeoverPortal` component is
  deleted.

- 70644e3: One briefing pack, assembled once, handed to both generation rungs

  What a writer is told about the host's product is now a single object,
  `BriefingPack` (`@vendoai/apps/contract`), rendered once by
  `renderBriefingPack` and read by both rungs: the screen agent and the in-box
  builder. It carries the theme verbatim, the host's design rules,
  `.vendo/brief.md`, the component catalog one line per entry, and the
  semantics-annotated tool shape card.

  This closes two silent gaps. `.vendo/brief.md` never reached the screen agent
  at all, and the in-box builder was told nothing about the brand, the rules, the
  catalog or the tool shapes. Instructions stay per-rung — the screen agent's
  dialect manual and the box's skin contract are different jobs.

  Breaking:

  - `@vendoai/apps` no longer exports `hostDesignBrief`. Compose a `BriefingPack`
    and call `renderBriefingPack` instead.
  - `AppsConfig.designRules` is replaced by `AppsConfig.briefing`. `AppsConfig.theme`
    survives for the served-app `?vendoTheme=` handoff only.
  - `GenerationDependencies` no longer carries `theme` / `designRules`, and
    `snapshotDesignRules` is removed with them.
  - `ScreenAssemblerDeps`' `design` and `system` slots collapse into one
    `briefing` slot, and `ScreenInput` takes a rendered `briefing` string.

  One removal a host can feel: the CONVERSATIONAL harness prompt no longer carries
  the design brief. `createVendo()`'s composed `turn.system` used to end with the
  `THEME TOKENS:` JSON and the `HOST DESIGN RULES:` block appended after the
  system prompt; that suffix is gone. What still reaches that prompt is the
  product brief and, through `catalogThemeSummary`, the host component lines plus
  a one-line theme sentence (density, motion, typography) — but NOT the theme
  token JSON and NOT `apps.designRules`. This follows from `claudeCode()` being
  the harness that RUNS a box rather than the thing that decides what an app is:
  the two writers that build apps — the screen agent and the in-box builder — both
  read the briefing pack, so the house rules reach every writer through one
  rendering instead of three. If your deployment relies on a `claudeCode()` turn
  obeying `apps.designRules` while editing `app.vendo` with its own hands, that
  turn is no longer told them; put those rules in `instructions` (`.vendo/brief.md`),
  which still rides that prompt.

  Otherwise host-facing configuration is unchanged:
  `createVendo({ theme, apps: { designRules } })` and
  `.vendo/{theme.json,design-rules.md,brief.md,catalog.json}` all still work, and
  now reach both generation rungs.

- d9ae728: One Claude Code integration, and automation authoring gets its own door

  The box carried **two** Claude Agent SDK loops: the conversational session door
  (`claude-turn.mjs`, the same module `machine: "local"` runs on a host) and a
  bespoke one-shot runner behind `/agent/task`. The duplicate is deleted. The
  supervisor's task door now drives the SAME `claude-turn.mjs` the session door
  does — one runner, two doors, three callers — keeping what only the task door
  needs: the box conventions the agent builds against, and the structured result
  the host polls for.

  **Box boundary — the one behavioral change.** That structured result now arrives
  as a FILE: the agent writes `/app/.vendo/report.json` and the supervisor reads
  it back, where it used to call an in-process `report_done` MCP tool. The shared
  runner's only MCP server is the host's own door, and a box task has none, so
  the report rides the one channel a box task and its supervisor already share.
  The JSON is the same shape it always was (`ok`, `summary`, `filesChanged`,
  `testsRun`, `fns?`, `servesUi?`) and it is still treated as DATA host-side —
  nothing in it can approve or authorize anything. **If you maintain a custom box
  image or your own in-box agent, this is the line to change**: end the task by
  writing that file instead of calling a tool. **The control-port protocol itself
  did not change** — `/agent/task` still answers `202 {taskId}` and
  `/agent/task/<id>` still answers `{status, result?, log}`, so nothing outside
  the box needed edits.

  Escalation now means exactly two rungs: the screen agent, and the box.
  Authoring an automation never needed a machine, so it is its own door:

  ```ts
  await apps.automation.author(
    {
      appId,
      instruction: "email me the unpaid invoices every Friday",
      mode: "steps",
    },
    ctx
  );
  // → { ok: true, document, triggerId, armed } | { ok: false, issues }
  ```

  The planner, the trigger-id rules, the results-board rewire and the arming are
  **unchanged** — `planAutomation` and its lane moved from
  `generation/lanes.ts` to `server/automation/{plan,lane}.ts` verbatim. An
  escalated plan that asks for an automation is routed to the same door, so both
  ways in land, arm and audit identically.

  **`<Server kind="steps">` and `<Server kind="agentic">` both still exist and
  still work — nothing was removed from the plan dialect.** What changed is where
  they lead: they are no longer _escalation kinds_ (branches of the server lane
  that could reach for a machine), they are the escalating agent's signal INTO
  the automation door. A plan that declares either authors exactly the automation
  it always did. `steps` remains the deterministic mode — a fixed step pipeline
  with no model call per firing — and `agentic` the judgment-per-run mode. Only
  `kind="box"` still means a machine, and it is now the only rung the ladder has.

  **Behavior fix:** `create` and `edit` no longer disagree about escalation.
  `create` used to refuse EVERY escalation on a deployment with no sandbox while
  `edit` refused only a box — so an automation you could ask for by editing an
  app you could not ask for by making one. Both now gate on the one expression
  (`escalationNeedsMachine`), and only the box rung needs a machine.

  **Migration:** `AppsRuntime` gains a required `automation` slot (a test double
  implementing the interface by hand must add it). No import path changed.

- 61b75bd: One definition per concept, and one door in

  Every app write that mints or changes a document now passes the same admission
  gate, and the concepts that were declared in five places are declared once.

  **The one door.** `admitAppDocument({document, origin})` ships from
  `@vendoai/apps/contract` — pure, browser-safe, structural schema plus the
  cross-field rules, with `validateAppDocument` still exported as its inner half.
  `origin` is recorded on the refusal and never changes what is checked. It is
  called from exactly one place: the row writer in `server/persistence`.

  **The door sanitises as well as validates.** The venue verdict (`inClient`),
  the drift report (`pinDrift`), the `dataUnavailable` claim and CDN furnishing
  packages are server-authoritative: only code that verified the hash, compared
  the baseline or ran the queries may assert them. They were stripped on the way
  OUT, which kept a forged claim off the wire but left it in the row — three
  write paths each remembered to strip first and `importApp` did not. The row
  writer strips them now, so a reader that forgets can no longer be wrong.
  **Pre-existing, fixed here rather than introduced here.**

  **One named exception, stated out loud:** `@vendoai/automations`' `writeApp`
  puts the row directly. Its two callers flip `enabled` on a document they
  round-tripped unchanged out of the store, and forcing them through admission
  would let a document stored before this door existed refuse a _disarm_ — a
  safety control must not fail by refusing to turn something off.

  **Breaking**

  - `@vendoai/mcp` no longer exports `AppsPort`. It was a structural mirror of
    `AppsRuntime`; the door types its apps ride-along off the real runtime, so
    the two can no longer disagree. Hosts that named the type should use
    `NonNullable<McpDoorConfig["apps"]>`. Note that the mirror typed `call` as
    `Promise<unknown>` while the umbrella has always wired `AppsRuntime.call`,
    which returns a `ToolOutcome` — the real shape is now visible in the types.
  - `appRecordInput`, `updateAppRow` and `persistEdit` (all internal to
    `@vendoai/apps`) take a required `AdmissionOrigin`. Required, not defaulted:
    a default would let a write path record itself anonymously.
  - `@vendoai/automations` renames its row type `AppRow` → `AppData` and drops its
    local `appRowSchema`, both of which now come from `@vendoai/apps/contract`.

  **Retired from the plan: the `vendo_make` envelope unification.**

  The MCP door was to answer `vendo_make` with the same `vendo/app-ref@1`
  envelope the in-process tool pack returns. It is not shipped, for two reasons:

  1. It breaks a tested door-parity law — the in-process leg and the door leg
     must return the same output, and the envelope made them disagree.
  2. It would make the door state something false. The envelope's `status` is
     pinned to the literal `"building"` and documented as _"never means done,
     win or lose"_, because it exists for the fast-return path where the build
     is still streaming. The MCP door does not stream; it runs `vendo_make` to
     completion. Wrapping a finished build in it tells an agent the app is not
     built when it is.

  The receipt is the honest answer on a door that runs to completion. Reviving
  this needs a non-`"building"` status and a deliberately rewritten parity law,
  as its own change.

  **Unifications**

  - `AppRow` / `AppData` / `appRowSchema` — the stored row, declared once in
    `@vendoai/apps/contract`. It was five: the store's projection, the automations
    engine's read shape, the persistence layer's `AppRowData`, a structural alias
    in `write-surface.ts`, and a narrower mirror in the umbrella's sync reader.
  - `data-vendo-view` — one producer, `vendoViewPart` in `@vendoai/core`. Four
    writers hand-built the part and only two validated it.
  - `WIRE_RESHAPE_OPS` is now derived from `RESHAPE_OPS` minus the aggregates
    rather than listed a second time, so the two cannot drift.
  - `stripServerAuthoritativeFields` moves to `@vendoai/apps/contract` (it is pure
    and browser-safe) and is re-exported from the package root, so the console can
    stop hand-copying it.
  - `AppData` is declared beside `AppRow` in the contract, replacing the console's
    mirror of a type `@vendoai/store` never exported.
  - The corpus structural layer's expected-files list gains `.vendo/catalog.json`
    and `.vendo/theme.extracted.json`, both of which every real `vendo init`
    writes; its duplicated tool-identity join collapses to one copy.

- 384eb09: The "Add to…" picker's destinations come from a per-user slot registry on the
  server instead of `localStorage`. A slot id is host markup, so nothing knows a
  slot exists until a page renders one — but the surface that offers it as a
  destination is usually a different page, and often a different device, which
  `localStorage` could never reach.

  A mounted `VendoSlot` now reports itself through `POST /slots` (batched: a whole
  page of slots is one request, and a client repeats a slot at most once a day, so
  one long-lived tab renews its slots instead of watching them age out), and
  `GET /slots` answers the
  caller's own slots, most recently seen first. Rows age out
  30 days after the last render that reported them, so a slot deleted from the
  codebase stops being offered on its own. The rows live in the generic records
  collection (`vendo_slots`), so there is no migration to run, and `refs.subject`
  puts them in the existing erase cascade.

  > **BREAKING:** `knownSlots`, `noteSlot` and the `SlotNote` type are removed
  > from the `@vendoai/ui` and `@vendoai/vendo/react` roots, and `useKnownSlots`
  > is removed from `@vendoai/ui/chrome`. Read the registry with the new
  > `useSlots()` hook (or `client.slots.list()`); a mounted `VendoSlot` still does

### Patch Changes

- 38b32a3: Security fix — a revoked secret no longer survives inside a box. When an owner
  turned a secret grant off, Vendo rebuilt the box's boundary env without that
  secret and pushed it to the machine, but the in-box supervisor MERGED the new set
  over the box's own process environment, where the value from provisioning still
  sat (a sandbox provider applies create-time env box-wide). The revoked key was
  simply absent from the new set rather than removed, so every app restart — and
  every in-box agent task — kept handing out a credential the owner had taken away,
  for the life of the machine. The boundary env now REPLACES the provisioned one:
  the app and the agent get exactly what the host injected plus the machine's own
  vars (`PATH`, `HOME`, …), so absence means gone.

  If you have already revoked a secret, two things are needed. First the box image:
  the supervisor is baked into it, so only machines created from a rebuilt template
  carry the fix — rebuild it (`packages/apps/box/build-template.mjs`) and point `VENDO_BOX_TEMPLATE`
  at the new id if you run your own sandbox account (on Vendo Cloud the image
  arrives with the release). Then, per affected app, `machine.destroy` followed by
  `machine.provision`: an existing machine's snapshot froze its environment at
  provision time and no wake re-sends it, so that snapshot keeps the old value until
  the machine is replaced. Nothing is stale on disk — the value only ever lived in
  the box's process environment, and the boundary env file the fix now treats as
  authoritative is rewritten on every injection, so a re-provisioned app self-heals
  with no migration. Rotating the credential is still the only way to invalidate a
  value a box has already read.

- 2fd14aa: An edit that did not save says so, and the format reference stops denying `<Plan display>`.

  A refused save degrades rather than throws — the app is on screen, it just is not in the
  store — and the assembler sits between that save and `edit()`, so the refusal had nowhere
  to go: `assembleEdit` re-read the row, found the PRE-edit document, and handed it back with
  no `failure`. An agent read that as done and the person's ask was silently lost. The save
  now records why it did not land, keyed by app and matched on the person's own words (the
  return leg `editIntents` already had), and the edit fails with that reason instead. The
  live trigger is a write-only refusal — chiefly the `assertCurrent` conflict when a skill's
  timer-save races an edit; a whole-store outage already self-reported through the read.

  The `.vendo` format reference promised it was taken from the parsers and then stated flatly
  that no `<Plan>` attribute but `name` is read, while `compilePlan` reads `display` and the
  `building-apps` skill on the same mount teaches `display="stage"` as load-bearing. A model
  that trusted the reference stripped it, and the app arrived as an inline card instead of a
  full-width stage. `display` is documented now, and the reference's own suite scans the
  compiler for the attributes it reads, so the next one fails the build until it is written
  down.

- 898eb8f: `@vendoai/apps` now ships its testing fixtures at the `./testing` subpath. The directory (`fake-sandbox`, `fake-box`, `scriptedLanguageModel`, `guardFixture`, `memoryStore`, and the rest) was already compiled into `dist/testing/` and already inside the published `dist` files-entry, but no `exports` key pointed at it, so it was dead weight in the tarball and unreachable to anyone — including this repo's own fixture suites, one of which carries the comment "the apps package's own test double is internal to that package" as the reason it hand-rolled a fortieth copy of a scripted model. Same posture as the `./adapter-conformance` subpath this package already publishes: testing material a host can use against the seams it implements. Purely additive — no existing subpath, type, or runtime behaviour changes.
- f25138f: `createApps` is an assembler now, not a 2,600-line function. Every private helper and every door it returned moved into a module beside its contract, each taking a `Pick` of the one shared closure type and returning its slice of `AppsRuntime` — the same shape the namespace surfaces already had. The public surface is unchanged: `@vendoai/apps` exports exactly what it exported, `runtime.ts` still re-exports every moved type and value, and no test changed. Pure refactor, no behaviour difference.
- 354f231: Remove undo and rollback entirely.

  **BREAKING, despite the patch version.** This release ships as a patch off the
  0.8 line (pre-1.0 convention), so the version number does NOT signal the removal
  below. If you call any export in the lists that follow, this release breaks your
  build — read them before upgrading. A `0.8.x` range accepts this version, so the
  version number alone will not hold it back.

  Two separate features, both cut: rolling an app back to a previous version, and
  walking a workspace file back to the version before its newest commit. **Users
  lose the ability to roll an app back.** That is deliberate. Pre-1.0, so this is
  a hard cut with no deprecation shim.

  Version history LISTING stays, everywhere: the app's capped 50-entry version log
  and the workspace's per-path revision trail are unchanged, and so is everything
  built on the recorded history — the review venue's newest-approved-version serve
  (`review.serveDocFor`), the pin-rebase replay trail (`history.pinIntents`), and
  the edit journal's append/discard/prune.

  Removed from `@vendoai/apps`:

  - `AppsRuntime.history(appId, ctx).undo()` — the surface now returns
    `{ list(): Promise<VersionEntry[]> }` only
  - `AppHistoryAccess.surface(appId).undo()` (the `createAppHistory` internal)

  Removed from `@vendoai/core`:

  - `StoreOps.workspace.undo(target, opts)`
  - `storeWireWorkspaceUndoRequestSchema`
  - the `"workspace.undo"` key from `STORE_WIRE_PATHS`, so the store wire is
    **31 doors, not 32** — `StoreWireStatus.ops` is now `31`, and the workspace
    family is 4 (index · read · commit · history)
  - the `workspace.undo` cases from the `storeOpsConformance` suite, and the
    `undo` implementation from `memoryStoreOps`

  Removed from `@vendoai/store`:

  - `workspaceStore(store).undo(caller, path)`
  - `WorkspaceRows.undo` and the `UndoOutcome` type (internal — never exported
    from the package index)
  - `createStoreOps(store).workspace.undo`, with its `pathsMovedOn`,
    `newestCommitTouching` and `commitCreated` helpers and the `created` array
    the commit ledger wrote for them
  - the `recordHistory` option on the internal write path, whose only `false`
    caller was undo — every landed write now records its superseded revision

  Removed from `@vendoai/ui`:

  - `VendoClient["apps"].undo(id)`
  - `useApp().history.undo()` — the hook's `history` is now `{ list() }`

  Removed from `@vendoai/vendo`:

  - the `POST /apps/:id/history` route (the `{ op: "undo" }` body). `GET
/apps/:id/history` is unchanged; the path now serves GET only
  - the `workspace.undo` leg of the hosted (Cloud) store adapter, which called
    the console's `POST /workspace/undo`

  **Existing data is left exactly where it is — no migration, no cleanup.**
  Existing `vendo_workspace_history` rows and `vendo:app-history:*` records stay
  readable by listing, but the content they hold becomes unrestorable: nothing
  reads it now. Those rows self-trim at `WORKSPACE_HISTORY_LIMIT` per path, except
  for a deleted path that is never written again, which holds its blob forever.
  That is a real consequence of removing the feature, and it is not repaired here.

- d599d23: `.vendo/tools.json` is the one source of truth for every tool's request and
  response schema, and the runtime sampler is gone.

  Sync fills both slots through a trust ladder and records which rung filled each
  one: the host's own spec (`declared`), its TypeScript types (`types`), the AI
  judge reading the handler (`inferred`), or nothing (`unknown`). The judge may
  only fill a slot nothing else could read — refused in code, not by prompt — and
  its fills survive the next sync through the same carry-over `semantics` uses.
  Coverage is reported plainly by `vendo sync`.

  Every prompt that lists tools now lists all of them: a tool with a declared
  schema shows its shape, and a tool with a blind slot says so in words. A blind
  input never prints as `{}`, which reads as "takes no arguments" — and a
  declared no-argument tool still prints the empty schema it really has.

  **Breaking, both pre-1.0:**

  - `AppsConfig.connectedToolkits` is removed from `@vendoai/apps`. Its only
    reader was the create-time shape sampler, which is deleted: nothing calls the
    host to learn a shape anymore. Drop the option; there is no replacement and
    nothing to migrate.
  - `deriveShapeCard`, `deriveShape`, `mergeShapes`, `ShapeCard` and
    `shapeCardSchema` are removed from `@vendoai/core`. Shapes come from declared
    JSON Schema now — use `shapeFromJsonSchema(schema)`, which additionally keeps
    `enum` values a sample always erased.

  A host that declares its response schemas gets strictly better checking and one
  fewer live call per create. A host that declares nothing keeps working: blind
  tools run permissively, and the report says which ones they are.

- a69aa5c: Delete the orphaned edit validator, and make `one-floor.test.ts` true again.

  `documentFromEdit`, `validateEditedApp` and their `issueLine` helper lost their
  only caller when "the brain dies" deleted `generation/conductor.ts`: an edit is
  the screen assembler rewriting the app's own `app.vendo` and saving it, so it is
  checked by the paint seam's floor and by nothing else. Nothing public changes —
  none of the three was exported from the package.

  `one-floor.test.ts` opened by claiming four doors "each through its own REAL
  entry point" and then drove its edit case through that orphan, so its edit-door
  proofs were proofs about a function nothing calls. It now drives three doors
  through `AppsRuntime.floor(ctx)`, `validate({ document })` and
  `validate({ appId })`, and says plainly that the edit path is the first of them.

  With the orphan goes its **carried-issue filter** — an edit was excused for an
  issue the previous version already carried. That rule was never re-implemented
  on this architecture and is not a behaviour production has: the floor runs on
  every commit for every author, and a block is a block.

- 7163a25: Every finished screen faces the AI reviewer, with the data it renders.

  A bills dashboard summed two overlapping query results into one headline: $11,216
  on screen over ~$6,276 of real bills (demo-bank, 2026-08-06). Every mechanical
  check passed, because a double count is not a shape error — the binding was well
  typed, the field existed, the tool was real. The reviewer is the only check that
  can see it, and it never ran: it fired only when the writing model volunteered to
  call `validate({appId})`, and that run did not.

  Two things change.

  **The reviewer is no longer optional.** It runs at both places a screen is
  finished — when the screen agent's assembly completes with a stored, painted app,
  and at the built path's turn boundary where the validate gate already runs. Its
  findings join the existing single repair round; there are no loops, and the
  reviewer's own fail-open posture is untouched — silence, a refusal and a failed
  request still all mean no findings, so a reviewer that could not judge never costs
  a person their screen. It is deliberately still absent from the paint seam, which
  runs on every save, and it is never spent on a document that did not pass the
  mechanical floor or never reached the screen.

  **The reviewer now sees the rows.** `validate({appId})` runs the app's own
  `<Query>` tools — read risk only, through the same guard-bound registry the screen
  itself reads from — and hands the results to the reviewer beside the printed
  markup. Its rubric gained one rule: check every total, count and average against
  those rows, including the overlap case where two queries return the same records
  and both get summed.

  The cost is exactly one reviewer model call per finished screen.

- 1022b2f: Every app-document read stops reinterpreting pre-split demo rows.

  `classifyLegacyPlacements` rewrote a stored `pins` entry whose `base` matched no
  captured baseline into `doc.placements` on the way out. It ran on ten read paths
  — `owned`, `list`, the files-first save, the review queue, the served snapshot,
  the venue-state re-read, the two approval surfaces, and inside both optimistic-
  concurrency `JSON.stringify` comparisons — so every reader of an app document had
  to know a shape only stale demo rows could have.

  Nothing produces that shape. The one writer was demo-bank's `/api/demo/pin`,
  deleted when placement became a first-class Vendo write; `pins.fork` and
  `pins.rebase` only ever record a captured baseline's own hash. Its output field
  is dead too: a placement is a `vendo_placements` row now, and no read mounts from
  `doc.placements`. For every row the runtime can write the shim was already the
  identity function, so no behaviour changes.

  A stored row still carrying the old shape now reads as what it says it is: a pin
  whose baseline is gone. It reports drift, it enters the ship diff, and it fails
  the export gate — instead of being silently reinterpreted.

- 2b6d60f: Remove the orphan wire text-edit surface and the inert reshape deprecation walker.

  `applyTextEdits`, `recompileWithIdentity`, `TextEdit` and `TextEditResult` are
  gone from `@vendoai/core`: the consumer was deleted when the conductor replaced
  the generation engine, and nothing has called them since. The four `<Edit>`
  patch issue codes they fed (`missing-edit`, `unknown-target`, `invalid-patch-op`,
  `patch-invalid`) go with them, and the two generation prompts stop teaching an
  `<Edit><Old><New>` dialect no parser reads — the "edit the text, never rewrite
  the file" rule stays.

  `findDeprecatedReshapeUsage` and its two orphaned constants
  (`DEPRECATED_RESHAPE_OPS`, `DEPRECATED_FORMAT_KINDS`) are also gone. The notices
  were never surfaced to anyone. The deprecated ops themselves keep compiling and
  rendering for stored apps exactly as before.

- b99147f: One component family: the legacy prewired set is retired, and the Kit is the
  only built-in vocabulary.

  Vendo shipped two component families that shadowed each other by name. The
  legacy prewired/branded set (`packages/ui/src/tree/{primitives,branded}.tsx`)
  won every name collision, so the Kit's `Stat` could never format a value, its
  `Text` was masked by a permissive one, and `DataTable`'s smart table sat behind
  a plain `Table`. That set is gone. One family now, declared once by
  `KIT_SPECS`, taught by `kitPrompt()`, resolved by the compiler, rendered by
  `KIT_COMPONENTS`, and validated from the same schemas.

  **Breaking — `@vendoai/ui/tree`.** These exports are removed: `Stack`, `Row`,
  `Grid`, `Text`, `Skeleton`, `Surface`, `Divider`, `Card`, `Button`, `Input`,
  `Select`, `Table`, `Badge`, `Stat`, `Tabs`, `PREWIRED_COMPONENTS`,
  `BRANDED_COMPONENTS`, and their prop types. Import the components from
  `@vendoai/ui/kit` instead — every name above except `Table` and `Skeleton`
  exists there with theme-token styling and real prop schemas.

  - **`Table` → `DataTable`.** The Kit table sorts, filters, searches,
    paginates, resolves dot-path column keys, and formats each cell. Its
    `columns` take `{key, label?, format?, align?}` objects rather than bare
    strings, `rows` is required, and `emptyLabel`/`rowKey` are `emptyState` and
    automatic respectively.
  - **`Skeleton` is no longer a component.** A loading placeholder is renderer
    chrome, not something a tree names, so it moved inside
    `tree/forming-skeleton.tsx` and off the public surface. It marks itself with
    `data-skeleton` (it was `data-primitive="Skeleton"`).
  - **`Tabs` keeps its tree contract.** The Kit `Tabs` now accepts the wire
    shape — string or `{value,label}` items, an initial `value`, and panels as
    CHILDREN in tab order — alongside its code-only `{label, content}` items.
    Tabbed apps are unaffected.
  - **`data-primitive` is gone.** Every built-in marks itself with `data-kit`;
    tests and styles selecting on `data-primitive` must be retargeted.

  **Reserved names now follow the Kit.** `RESERVED_COMPONENT_NAMES`,
  `BRANDED_COMPONENT_NAMES`, and `PREWIRED_COMPONENT_NAMES` are removed from
  `@vendoai/core`; `KIT_COMPONENT_NAMES` and `KIT_WIRE_COMPONENT_NAMES` replace
  them, so a generated component may not shadow any Kit name.

  Two schemas were widened where the retired family had been quietly absorbing
  real usage: `Text.text` takes `string | number` (matching its `ReactNode`
  implementation), and a single-segment `$state` read binds into any prop again
  while `state.key.deeper` stays a compile error.

  Stored apps naming `Table` or `Skeleton` render the contained
  "Unknown component" notice on that node while every sibling still renders.

- b99147f: One theme→CSS-variable mapping, owned by `@vendoai/core`.

  The same `VendoTheme` was flattened into `--vendo-*` custom properties in three
  places — the ui chrome, the MCP door's connect/consent pages, and the MCP Apps
  shim's `:root{}` block — each a hand-kept copy of the others, and they had
  drifted: the door emitted 16 of the 32 variables the chrome does, so a themed
  MCP page never saw `--vendo-color-scheme`, `--vendo-base-size`, the density
  sizing scale, or the motion timings. `defaultVendoTheme`, `resolveTheme`,
  `colorSchemeForBackground` and `themeCssVariables` now live in
  `@vendoai/core` (and are exported from it); `@vendoai/ui` re-exports them
  unchanged, and both MCP paths are a one-line serialization of the same call.
  `VENDO_THEME_VARIABLE_NAMES` is read off that mapping, so the generation
  prompt's brand-token line and the shim's reverse read cannot fall behind a
  rename.

  Two brand bugs fell out of the merge. The Kit's token fallbacks had `surface`
  and `background` swapped, so an unthemed Kit painted a white page with
  off-white cards inverted; its `fontFamily` fallback had also lost the Onest
  brand stack. Both now derive from `defaultVendoTheme` instead of being retyped.

  The phantom `--vendo-space-*` variables are gone. Nothing ever emitted them, so
  every reference rendered its fallback; the door pages, the Kit's `Stack`/`Row`
  gap, and the tree's notice and open-in-product card now use the real
  `--vendo-density-*` variables where the scale matches, and the literal
  elsewhere. Rendered output is unchanged.

- 5e8a141: A steered turn now ends when the engine says it is over, not when a guessed
  number of `result` messages have arrived.

  The live Claude session gave each steer one extra `result` to absorb, on the
  belief that every user message the engine answers produces exactly one. Nothing
  guarantees that — the engine's own docs describe a queued batch being "coalesced
  into one turn", which is also what steering is documented to do (the words reach
  the model at its next step boundary). One result short and the count swallowed
  the FINAL result too, so `send()` waited out the whole 15-minute message budget
  for work that had already finished. The count is now only a cap on the wait; the
  engine's `session_state_changed` → `idle`, which its own schema calls the
  "authoritative turn-over signal", is what ends the turn. The session asks for
  that event explicitly (`CLAUDE_CODE_EMIT_SESSION_STATE_EVENTS`), and an engine
  that never sends it falls back to exactly the old behaviour.

- 8f3d23a: Box door: a session that fails to open now hands its in-flight slot back, so a
  box whose SDK import fails answers 500 once instead of 409 "a message is
  already running" forever.

  fn names: one bounded `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}` pattern instead of two that
  disagreed, so a long fn name no longer dispatches in-process while the HTTP wire
  route refuses it.

  Review queue: each app's rejection rows are paged once per queue build, not
  twice.

  Removed two surfaces with no callers: `explicitSamplingParams` /
  `SamplingRequest` (never on any export path) and `EgressApprovals.pending`.

- be9f3e9: The apps contract now sits beside its implementation.

  `createApps` was one 2,942-line closure, and the `AppsRuntime` interface it
  implements sat ~2,000 lines above it in the same file — so reading any single
  verb meant scrolling between two distant halves of `runtime.ts`. The contract and
  the shapes its verbs speak move to `types.ts`, and four of the nested namespaces
  (`access`, `inClient`, `review`, `pins`) each get their own module taking a small
  shared context, the same shape `interchange`/`history`/`review` already use.
  `pins` alone was 315 lines inline; its orchestration now lives in `pins-surface.ts`
  beside the pure logic that was always in `pins.ts`.

  Internal refactor only — the public surface is unchanged. Every type is still
  exported from `@vendoai/apps` and still re-exported from `./runtime.js`, no
  behaviour moved with the code, and the package's full suite passes untouched.

- 2b49b64: Three of this block's densest functions are decompositions now. The agent-tool registry's `execute` is a dispatcher: `vendo_make` and its two routes moved to `make-tool.ts`, the three `vendo_apps_data_*` doors to `data-tools.ts`, and the argument checks both share to `tool-args.ts`. `validatePlan` hands its steps rules to a `stepsIssues` collector beside the `scheduleIssues` one it already had, and the Claude session loop reads its `query()` options and its assistant-message scan from two named siblings — siblings, not modules, because `dist/claude-turn.js` is copied verbatim into the box image and has no relative imports to give them. No public surface changed, no behaviour changed, and no test changed.
- 6fb568a: Replace the RFC-6901 JSON Pointer writer in `open.ts` with a direct assignment
  under the query's name. The pointer was always `"/" + query.name`, and both
  producers of a query name (`validateTree` and the wire compiler) hold it to
  `/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/`, so no separator, escape or index could ever
  reach it. The prototype defence stays, as an own-property define — the same
  8-line shape `ui/src/tree/mcp-shim/shim-core.ts` already ships.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 963d980: Agents can address a place on the page, and a slot tells the truth about what is in it.

  An agent could make a person a screen, but never say WHERE it goes: a host wired
  exactly one destination and everything landed there. Now a slot is something the
  agent can name, the person can choose, and the page can be honest about.

  **Placement is a row, not a string on the app document.** "Show this app in that
  slot" moves off `doc.placements` — which is never read any more — and into real
  rows in the generic collections: a pointer at `plc:<subject>:<slot>` naming who
  holds the slot under which token (the single compare-and-swap arbitration
  point), and a live row at `plcv:<subject>:<slot>:<token>` that exists only while
  that placement holds it. That buys three things a document scan could not: a
  slot can show a build that has not landed yet, a slot resolves in one query
  instead of listing every app the person owns, and one app per slot is enforced
  by the write instead of by whoever read last.

  - `apps.place({ app, slot })` / `apps.unplace(…)` / `apps.placements({ slots })`
    on the runtime, `POST /apps/:id/place`, `POST /apps/:id/unplace` and
    `GET /apps/placements?slots=…` on the wire, `client.apps.place/unplace/
placements` on the client.
  - `place()` is one decision, not read-then-write: it compare-and-swaps on the
    pointer's revision, the loser retries against the winner's row, and the
    displaced app comes back as `evicted` so the surface can say what moved.
  - `unplace()` and "clear this slot" only ever delete the token they named, so a
    stale client can never evict the app that replaced it. Tokens are never
    reused.
  - Rows carry `refs.app_id`, and deleting an app sweeps them BY APP — so deleting
    an app you share can no longer leave a permanent "didn't build" card standing
    over somebody else's host markup.
  - `GET /apps/placements` gates every entry on the same viewer check
    `open`/`get`/`list` use; a slot the caller may no longer view reads as empty.
    Slot ids are normalized identically on read and write, and percent-encoded per
    item in the query, so an id containing a "," survives the round trip.
  - `useSlotApp(slot)` now answers `{ appId, status }`, over ONE poller per client
    shared by every mounted slot (it no longer takes `pollMs`).

  **`vendo_make` takes one optional `slot`,** honoured on both engines the one
  front door routes to. The slot is claimed at MINT — the instant the app id
  exists, before a single token is generated — so the place the caller aimed at
  shows the build forming instead of staying empty until it lands, and shows the
  failure if it never does. An ask no engine landed writes the same terminal
  tombstone a failed build writes, so a claimed slot turns into the honest failure
  card the moment either engine gives up. A placement whose app no longer exists
  renders as nothing placed, never a stuck failure card. On a CHANGE, `slot` is
  refused by name: silently moving an existing app would evict whatever holds that
  slot off the back of an edit nobody aimed there.

  **Two new tools do the moving.** `vendo_apps_pin { app, slot }` puts an app the
  user already has into a slot and reports what it replaced as `evicted`;
  `vendo_apps_unpin { app, slot }` takes it out and leaves the app itself alone.
  Both aim by the app's id OR the name the user said, and both are graded `write`
  — a placement row is small and reversible.

  Neither is offered to an unattended run, and neither is executable in one.
  `PRESENCE_ONLY_TOOLS` (core) joins THE LAW's projection, and the guard's choke
  point refuses a presence-only call outright — so a standing automation grant
  that reaches `execute()` by name, without listing, can no longer rearrange a
  page with nobody watching. Keyed on the name, not the grade, so policy rules and
  consent cards still read an honest `write`. A slot-bearing `vendo_make` in an
  unattended run still RUNS and simply drops the slot: placement is what needs a
  person present, creation is not, and refusing the call would silently break the
  automations that legitimately build screens.

  **`McpDoorConfig.withholdTools`** names tools one door never offers, checked
  BEFORE the `vendo_` prefix bypass and on BOTH legs of a mount — a turn-bearing
  session used to be able to list and call a name the deployment said it never
  offers. Curation, not security: a withheld name answers with the same in-band
  not-found an unknown name gets.

  **`VendoSlot` reads the placement's build status, not just its app id:**

  - **building** — an EMPTY slot shows the skeleton it already uses, minus the
    invitation, because there is nothing left to ask for. A slot carrying the
    host's own markup KEEPS it until the build is ready: a working host component
    never blanks into a skeleton for the length of a build.
  - **failed** — the consumer sentence (never the wire's `reason`, which names
    components and env vars and is written for whoever can fix the build), a "Try
    again" that re-issues the ORIGINAL request when the failed record kept one,
    and "Clear this slot". The failed card DOES replace the host's own children,
    deliberately: a build that will never land should not hide behind markup that
    looks fine.
  - **ready** — unchanged, and now proven in a browser for both surface kinds.

  **`AddToPicker` puts "Add to…" on a generated view's bar,** so a person can send
  it to any slot the host has mounted instead of the one place a host wired. It
  awaits `client.apps.place` before saying "Added to Hero", then announces the
  placement so a mounted slot fills without waiting out its poll. It appears in
  both places a generated view has a bar — the app embed and the IN-THREAD card,
  which is the surface a person actually reaches a view from in every host that
  renders its conversation through `VendoOverlay`. The affordance stays a
  one-click "Pin to dashboard" while the origin knows a single destination — a
  menu of one is not a choice — and becomes the picker the moment it knows more.

  - `noteSlot` / `knownSlots` (new, re-exported from `vendoai/react`): the picker's
    destinations. A slot id is the host's markup and no Vendo record carries it, so
    a mounted `VendoSlot` recording itself in origin-scoped `localStorage` is the
    only way a surface on another page can offer that slot at all. A slot the host
    filled with an explicit `appId`/`pin` stays out of the list — a placement
    written into it would never be read.

  **Pinning is Vendo's write now:** with `pinSlot` set, the pin affordance calls
  `apps.place` itself. `onPin` remains as an optional side-effect seam, so a host
  no longer needs a pin route of its own (Maple's is deleted).

- b022eb3: Lift the turn loop out of `createAgent`, and expose the cross-block seams behind
  `/internal`.

  `@vendoai/agent`'s inner loop is now its own module so a harness can DRIVE it
  instead of reimplementing it. Behaviour is unchanged — the package's own test
  suite is the specification for the lift and passes unmodified.

  - `loop.ts` owns the `streamText` call: the step cap, `buildFailedStop`, the
    history window, the Anthropic cache breakpoints, the abandoned-approval
    provider rewrite, the tool-search loadout, and the step-limit notice.
  - `wire-error.ts` owns `wireErrorMessage`, so a second caller raises the
    IDENTICAL failure affordance — banner, Retry, detail line, and the
    meter-exhausted sentence — rather than inventing a second error UX.
  - `tools.ts`'s guarded-call path and approval preview are reachable as
    `guardedCall(descriptor, options)` and `previewApproval(descriptor, options,
onAsk)`. Both are CURRIED so the ai-SDK still invokes the body directly: an
    extra microtask before an abort raised inside a tool changes whether a dangling
    `input-available` tool part reaches the transcript.

  **Host-facing surfaces are unchanged.** Everything above ships behind
  `@vendoai/agent/internal` and `@vendoai/apps/internal` — the idiom
  `@vendoai/core/conformance` already sets. The only supported consumer is another
  `@vendoai/*` block, so these stay free to change without a major bump:

  - `@vendoai/agent/internal`: `startTurn`, `providerHistory`, `turnModelMessages`,
    `DEFAULT_MAX_STEPS`, `wireErrorMessage`, `guardedCall`, `previewApproval`,
    `addAgentTool`, `buildAgentTools`, `createToolSearchSession`,
    `assembleSystemPrompt`, `validateUpsert`, `abandonPendingApprovals`,
    `guardApprovalIds`.
  - `@vendoai/apps/internal`: `assembleTree`, `stripServerAuthoritativeFields` —
    so the harness runtime's render seam emits the payload shape the shipped
    emitter emits instead of keeping a drifting copy.

- 1572060: An app's code reaches the store, so the box is disposable.

  `AppDocument.source` and the `checkoutApp`/`commitApp` seam landed with the
  contract but with ZERO production callers: every build still persisted code only
  into the sandbox snapshot behind `machine.snapshotRef`, so losing a snapshot lost
  the customer's app. This wires the commit half in.

  - `RenderSeamOptions.commitSource` is the sibling of `authoredApp` on the SAME
    interception point. `commit()` is the store-write moment, and the reason is the
    one already stated in `render-seam.ts`: the sandbox sync-back path commits
    without ever calling `writeFile` on this façade, so a builder working inside a
    box reaches the store here and nowhere else. It runs once per APP a commit
    touched, with `CommitResult.changed` verbatim; a `conflict` result persists
    nothing, because nothing landed.
  - `AppsRuntime.commitSource` is the store half, binding `commitApp` to the app
    row's ownership (§9.7 — the address comes from the owner, never from which
    mount happens to be writable), its compare-and-swap update, and — new —
    `AppsConfig.files`, the SAME `FilesAdapter` the workspace rows spill to.
  - The `HOT_PATH` regex became one `APP_PATH` regex with the filename as a tail,
    so "which app is this path in?" has one answer for the hot paths and the source
    tree alike. No second path reader.
  - Source persistence can never fail the commit it rides on, exactly as a view
    cannot — but a silently dropped source file is a lost app, so a failure is
    logged loudly rather than swallowed.

  `machine.snapshotRef` is now a cache in fact and not only in the doc comment: the
  audit found no reader of it anywhere that recovers source (`SandboxMachine` has no
  file-read method at all), and the new seam test deletes an app's snapshot, proves
  `resume` fails, and rebuilds the app from its row alone into a store that has
  never held its files — byte for byte, including a file past the inline cap so the
  blob-spill leg is proven too. `trigger`, `placements`, grants and the app's id all
  ride through untouched: a commit is not a generation.

  Two things that ride along, because this PR is `commitApp`'s first real caller and
  both only become reachable with one:

  - **`commitSource` is a new authorization surface, so it is tested hostilely.** The
    appId it writes to is derived from the COMMITTED PATHS, and a caller may write
    anything under their own `/user` mount — including another person's app
    directory. Three cases are now pinned: a foreign caller is refused and the
    refusal is AUDIBLE rather than a silent skip; an org-owned app resolves to its
    ORG address even when the caller's personal mount is writable too; and a commit
    naming a stranger's app alongside the caller's own lands nothing on the
    stranger's while still landing the caller's. All three pass against the gates
    Phase 0 already put in — these document them, they do not add them.
  - **"Would not read" is no longer treated as "was deleted."** `commitApp` decided
    deletions by whether the read-back threw, and for a spilled file that read is a
    live fetch from the files adapter — so a blob store having a bad minute looked
    exactly like a deletion and the entry was dropped. Now a path that still EXISTS
    but will not read keeps its stored entry and says so loudly; only a confirmed
    absence is a deletion. Per path, so the rest of the commit still lands.

- a004031: **BREAKING:** the bench host surface is removed from `@vendoai/apps` —
  `loadDemoBankCatalog`, `loadDemoBankTools`, and `demoBankToolShapes` are no
  longer exported. The `HostToolInfo` type stays.

  The W1-bench experiments those loaders served have concluded (verdicts:
  inline refs ADOPT; builder-calls, fetch-then-generate, CFG-JSX DEFER — the
  ledger lives in the private repo), and the loaders themselves could never have
  worked for an npm consumer: they resolved `examples/demo-bank/.vendo/*.json`
  relative to this repo's layout, so every call outside the monorepo threw. The
  one real caller (an internal bench harness, since moved out of this repo) now
  loads the catalog and tools locally.

- 21c8b10: **BREAKING:** the BYO schedule engine is gone — a machine app's `vendo.json`
  schedules are document triggers now, fired by the automations engine.

  `AppsRuntime.schedules` (its `tick`, `sync` and `report`) and the
  `SCHEDULE_STATE_COLLECTION` export are removed. `machine.syncManifest(appId, ctx)`
  folds a woken box's declared schedules into the app's document triggers and
  `machine.report()` says what happened, so last-fired state lives on the engine's
  per-trigger cursor instead of in a second `vendo_app_schedules` cache that a tick
  had to read to decide due-ness. A host that called `runtime.schedules.tick()` from
  its cron should call the one `/api/vendo/tick` door instead — it already drove the
  automation schedules, and it now drives these.

  Authoring changed in the same direction: the planner is never offered a tool whose
  unattended use is irreversible (the predicate is core's own
  `withheldFromUnattended`, the same one the run's projection uses, so authoring and
  firing cannot disagree), and an ask that needs one comes back as a sentence naming
  why and offering the away-safe half — read the live data, publish the result, and
  let the person do the irreversible part themselves. `planAutomation` is exported
  so a harness can author a plan without booting the generation pipeline.

- 1bb535b: The checks floor moves to the paint seam, and `instant()` is removed.

  ## BREAKING: `instant()` is gone

  `instant()`, `InstantHarnessDeps` and `InstantHarnessOptions` are removed from
  `@vendoai/harnesses` and from the `@vendoai/vendo/server` re-export. Two engines
  and no third: the lean `vendo()` loop, and the builder on the claude-code
  runtime.

  The specialist existed to put a layout on screen in seconds by routing an app ask
  straight at the guarded engine tool. The paint seam now does exactly that for
  **every** harness — a plan file renders its skeleton the moment it parses,
  whoever wrote it — so its whole reason for being was absorbed by the thing every
  thinker already rides.

  **If you had `harness: instant()`:** delete it. The slot's default is `vendo()`,
  which is the same guard, the same audit trail, the same view channel, and the
  same skeleton-in-seconds behaviour.

  ```diff
  - import { createVendo, instant } from "@vendoai/vendo/server";
  + import { createVendo } from "@vendoai/vendo/server";

    export const vendo = createVendo({
  -   harness: instant(),
      auth: { ... },
    });
  ```

  ## The checks floor runs on every commit, for every author

  The render seam compiled `app.vendo` with `compileWire(content)` and **no
  options**, so it spoke a different dialect than every other compile of model
  wire. Measured, both directions:

  - a lying binding — a `$path` naming a field the tool's response shape does not
    have — compiled to `issues: []` and `bindingErrors: []`. "The engine's
    unshippable gate" was structurally dead on the files-first path, and the app
    painted a label promising a number it could never show.
  - an app built on inline tool references had its binding **dropped** and its
    query never minted, and painted anyway, because the tree kept its children.

  So nothing checked a harness's own writes. The floor was live for the built-in
  conductor and structurally dead for every other author — a builder writing
  `app.vendo` with its own hands, a human with an editor.

  Now composition injects the floor into the seam (`RenderSeamOptions.floor`, built
  from the new `AppsRuntime.floor(ctx)`). Every commit to `app.vendo` compiles in
  the production dialect and runs the seven deterministic fact checks plus whatever
  the host plugged in through a pack. A blocking finding means the view does not
  paint — through the seam's existing "emits nothing, the last good view stays"
  mechanism, not a new failure channel — and the write still lands, so `validate`
  can read it back and repair it.

  Hosts need no code change for this: the seam is wired in composition.

  ## `validate` runs the whole floor, and the builder must pass it

  `AppsRuntime.validate` built its layer from `config.checks` alone, so it ran the
  fact checks and skipped the AI reviewer. The building-apps skill teaches
  "validate after every edit", and what it taught could not see invented data,
  dishonest tool use, dead controls, dropped work, or a single one of the host's
  own judgment **rules**. The reviewer is now composed in, fail-open as everywhere
  else: silence, a refusal, and a failed request all mean no findings.

  The claude-code harness's loop now requires it. After the turn's work reaches the
  store, the loop calls the same registered `validate` verb through
  `turn.tools.call` and, if an app document does not pass, hands the findings back
  for **one** bounded fix round. New exports for hosts driving their own harness
  loop: `validateWrittenApps`, `repairInstruction`, `VALIDATE_TOOL` from
  `@vendoai/harnesses`.

  ## `Finding` carries its check

  `Finding` gains an optional `check` naming the `Check` that produced it, stamped
  by the checking layer. Additive — existing readers are unaffected — but code that
  asserts exact `Finding` object equality will see the extra field. It makes
  architecture design §7's carve-out ("except host-check failures, which only the
  host can waive") representable for the first place: a built-in fact finding and a
  host's own plugged check were previously the same anonymous object.

  ## Also

  `@vendoai/core` gains the `AppFloor` port. The generation conductor is
  **quarantined** (`@deprecated`): its callers are frozen, not extended, and new
  work uses the lean loop with the floor at the seam.

- 10a2b44: `createVendo({ agent })` accepts a whole `@vendoai/agents` agent, and the sandbox
  ladder has one implementation.

  `createVendo`'s `agent` key is now a union: either the chat-context knobs it has
  always taken (now exported as `AgentOptions`) or the value `agent()` from
  `@vendoai/agents` returned. Handed an agent, the deployment adopts what that
  agent already composed — its harness, its store and blob adapter, its
  egress-skinned sandbox, and its `instructions` — so the embed's turns run on the
  same brain, the same transcript and the same box as `session.stream`. Passing any
  of `harness`, `store`, `files` or `sandbox` alongside an agent is a boot error
  naming each conflict, instead of one side silently losing.

  The guard and the host tool surface stay the deployment's: the embed's choke
  point carries org policy and app-tool risk grading, and its tools come from
  `.vendo/tools.json`. The agent's own guard and tools keep serving its `session()`
  calls.

  `VENDO_API_KEY` now fills an `agent()` sandbox slot the host left unset with the
  managed Cloud pool — importing `@vendoai/vendo` registers the Cloud rung the
  standalone runtime leaves open. An explicitly passed adapter still wins. The
  Cloud STORE rung stays open pending the tenant-store design, so an unset `store:`
  with only a Vendo key still refuses and names `store: postgres(url)`.

  `@vendoai/apps` gains the `./sandbox-ladder` subpath: `selectSandbox(configured,
cloudRung)` is now the ONE implementation of the adapter rule's sandbox ladder
  (explicit → `E2B_API_KEY` → the Cloud rung → nothing), shared by the umbrella and
  the standalone agent runtime. `SandboxVenue` moves there with it.

- 2722d81: The wire dialect becomes a strict TSX subset, with one call grammar.

  `compileWire` and `printWire` change surface syntax. A document already stored as
  a canonical tree is unaffected — the IR is untouched, `$reshape` still carries the
  same steps — but wire TEXT written against the old grammar no longer compiles,
  which is why this is a major bump.

  - **Reshapes are value-first nested calls.** `{revenue.rows | asPoints(month,
revenue)}` becomes `{asPoints(revenue.rows, "month", "revenue")}`, and a chain
    nests instead of piping: `rename(pick(q.rows, "month"), "month", "label")`.
    Reading the nesting from the inside out reads the steps in order. Field
    arguments are quoted strings; bare identifiers in argument position are gone.
    The printer emits chains inside-out under the unchanged byte-identical
    round-trip law, and it refuses to print a step no longer writable on the wire,
    falling back to the quoted object literal.
  - **Every aggregate names its field.** `sum(invoices.amount_cents)` becomes
    `sum(invoices.data, "amount_cents")`; `count(rows)` is unchanged. The implicit
    column read is gone from the call surface — an aggregate reads
    `rows.field` explicitly.
  - **`group_by` takes the rows it groups, plus a descriptor.**
    `group_by(rows, "issued_at", "month", sum.of("amount_cents"))` — arity 3 to 4.
    Because the rows are an argument, the old "aggregates the SAME rows it groups"
    inference retires with the grammar that needed it, and `count.of()` replaces
    `count(rows)` in the aggregate slot.
  - **Comments are JSX comments.** `{/* … */}` replaces `<!-- … -->`; the HTML form
    is no longer a comment.
  - **Braces in text are refused**, as the new `braces-in-text` issue code.
    `<Text>Total: {q.total}</Text>` rendered the braces literally; a value reaches
    the screen through a binding (`<Text text={q.total}/>`).

  **Two aggregate vocabularies collapse into one, and `avg` retires.** The dialect
  had a reshape `avg` and an expression `average` on the same surface, where the
  wrong one silently dropped the attribute. The surviving names are `sum, count,
average, min, max, difference, days_until, group_by`. `avg` is removed from
  `RESHAPE_OPS`; `sum`/`min`/`max`/`count` stay in the registry for STORED
  documents but are no longer writable on the wire, so exactly one `sum` is
  reachable. The numeric reduce behind both is now a single exported
  `reduceNumeric`.

  `WIRE_RESHAPE_OPS`, `isWireReshapeOp`, `reduceNumeric` and
  `AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTORS` are new exports; `EXPR_CALLS` is unchanged.

- 56e0cc3: **BREAKING:** escalation gets its receiving end, and both experimental flags are
  deleted. `apps.experimentalScreenAgent` and `apps.experimentalMachines` are gone
  from `createVendo()`; passing either is now a type error.

  **The screen agent is THE engine.** Every `vendo_make` ask starts in the cheap
  assembly loop on every deployment. There is no flag and no coin-flip. The
  conductor is unchanged and is still what an `unavailable` answer, a broken
  assembler, or an `assembled` that left no app row falls through to.

  **Machine-backed execution is gated by the sandbox adapter, and nothing else.**
  Configure `createVendo({ sandbox })` and layer-2 boxes are reachable; leave it
  out and they are not. Presence IS the deliberate opt-in — no capability boolean
  beside it. Every read site moved: the box lane in `laneGates`, the box seam
  inside the generation pipeline, and `apps.machine.provision`, whose refusal now
  names the missing sandbox instead of a flag. Layer 3 is unchanged: a narrowing
  of layer 2 that additionally needs the mounted wire and `VENDO_BASE_URL`.

  **`escalate` now lands somewhere.** It used to fall through to the conductor with
  the plan discarded — which meant the person watched a skeleton, then watched an
  unrelated app replace it. Two answers now, and the deployment's own shape picks
  which:

  - **A sandbox is configured** → the build runs. The same `create` a
    server-needing ask has always taken, at the SAME app id, so the plan's skeleton
    and the finished app share one stream and the outline becomes the app in place.
  - **No sandbox** → a `failed` receipt whose `say` names the capability gap in the
    person's own terms. Not a fall-through: the conductor is assembly too, so it
    cannot serve what assembly just escalated, and trying would spend a whole
    build's latency to arrive at a worse version of the screen already on screen.
    The still-forming card is unmounted by the UI once the turn is over, so the
    receipt is the last word rather than a permanent shimmer.

  **The build anchors on the escalated plan.** `AppsRuntime.create` takes an
  additive `plan?: string` — the ask still travels verbatim and the plan rides
  beside it as the brief, so the brain builds the outline the person is watching
  rather than re-answering the ask from scratch. The plan is read back out of the
  app's workspace through a new adapter slot, `AppsConfig.escalatedPlan`, filled by
  composition for the same reason `AppsConfig.screen` is: `@vendoai/apps` holds no
  workspace. Unfilled, the build plans from the ask exactly as before.

  Additive surface: `AppsRuntime.machine.available()` (is a sandbox configured),
  and `escalatedPlanPath(appId)` from `@vendoai/harnesses` so the writing and the
  reading side cannot spell the plan's path two ways.

  **Migration:** delete `apps: { experimentalScreenAgent: true }` — it is the
  default now. Delete `apps: { experimentalMachines: true }` — if the deployment
  already passes a `sandbox`, machines stay on with no further change; if it does
  not, machines were never reachable anyway.

- a004031: **BREAKING:** the `apps.fillConcurrency` config knob is removed —
  `createVendo({ apps: { fillConcurrency } })`, `AppsConfig.fillConcurrency`,
  and `ConductorOptions.fillConcurrency` are gone.

  Nothing ever set it: not the umbrella's own composition, not a demo, not a
  doc beyond the config listing, so every fill has always run at the built-in
  default of 2 groups at a time and still does. `fillPlan`'s own `concurrency`
  option (the internal dial the fill tests exercise) is unchanged; only the
  never-wired public spelling is removed. A host that passes it will now get a
  type error — delete the key, the behavior is identical.

- fbf265b: One front door: `vendo_make` replaces `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit`,
  and it hands back words instead of the app.

  **Breaking.** `vendo_apps_create` and `vendo_apps_edit` no longer exist. In their
  place is one tool with three parameters:

  ```ts
  {
    request: string,   // the ask, in the calling agent's own words — required
    app?: string,      // an existing AppId, to change that one specifically
    context?: string,  // free-text background, for callers whose conversation we cannot see
  }
  ```

  Two tools meant every calling agent — ours, a host's own AI SDK or Mastra agent,
  an outside agent over MCP — had to decide "new or change?" before it could ask,
  and get it right. That was never their decision: the seam knows whether an app
  exists, and a caller that wants a specific one says so with `app`. `context`
  exists because an outside agent's transcript is not ours to read; on our own
  doors the runtime's transcript stays authoritative and `context` is supplemental.

  **Also breaking: the tool returns a receipt, not the document.**

  ```ts
  interface MakeReceipt {
    id: AppId;
    title: string;
    status: "ready" | "building" | "failed";
    say: string; // ONE speakable line, consumer voice
  }
  ```

  The old tools returned the entire `AppDocument` — the tree, the island sources,
  the storage declarations, the machine reference. So a model was handed UI and
  trusted not to describe it, retell it, or invent from it. A model handed a tree
  eventually talks about the tree. Screens go server → slot; the agent only ever
  gets words, and `say` is the line it can utter verbatim. `status: "building"` is
  the honest answer while work continues.

  Two things follow from the receipt, and both are improvements rather than
  compromises. The automation card is now PUBLISHED by the apps runtime through the
  existing view-stream seam instead of being reconstructed at the agent bridge out
  of the edit tool's return value — one less part read by shape (01-core §16's own
  anti-smuggling rule, which that reconstruction was the exception to). And
  `instant()` now speaks the receipt's `say` rather than a canned "Updated.",
  which fixes a real mis-speak: a rejected change comes back OK, so the canned line
  claimed success for work that did not happen.

  **Migrating.** If you call the tool by name from your own agent, rename it and
  rename `prompt` → `request` and `appId` → `app`; drop `instruction` into
  `request`. If you read fields off its result, read `id` and `title` off the
  receipt and say `say`. If you had a policy rule or an override matching
  `vendo_apps_create` / `vendo_apps_edit` / `vendo_apps_*` for the build tools,
  match `vendo_make` — it deliberately sits OUTSIDE the `vendo_apps_` prefix,
  because it is the front door rather than a member of the runtime's family. Core
  exports `isVendoAppsTool(name)` for anything that needs to recognise both.

  Everything else about the call is unchanged: risk grade `read` (actions inside
  the screen are still graded and consented individually at call time), the view
  channel, the build-failed banner, and the transcript's build card.

- ce98c54: One validation floor at every door, and a host's declared tool schemas finally
  reach the screen type check.

  Four doors let an app reach a screen — the paint seam, `validate({ document })`,
  `validate({ appId })` and the edit path — and each ran a different subset of the
  checks, so an app refused at one shipped through another. An island that crashes
  the moment it renders was caught at exactly one of them. All four now compose
  the same `floorChecks`: the fact checks, the compiler static half, and the island
  gates (admission plus the smoke render). The AI reviewer has not moved — it still
  runs only where it ran before, at `validate`, because it spends a model call.

  The island gates move from `generation/validation/` into `checking/`, where the
  floor that runs them lives; the generation pipeline imports them from there. On
  the paint hot path a repeated save costs ~3ms more, because the smoke render is
  keyed on island source and an unchanged island never renders twice.

  `screenTypings` has always preferred a tool's DECLARED `outputSchema` over the
  shape sampled from one live call, and nothing ever populated it. It does now, so
  a screen is type-checked against the host's own contract. Sampling erases what a
  declaration keeps: an enum field samples as a bare `string`, so a host component
  whose prop takes that enum could never be satisfied by any tool — demo-bank's
  `MapleSpendingDonut` against `host_getSpendingInsights` was blocked at the checks
  floor on a screen that was correct.

- d0c3cc9: Risk grading stops guessing from tool names, and a tool nobody has graded now
  says so out loud instead of running.

  **The word lists are gone.** Extraction used to read a tool's name against
  `DESTRUCTIVE_WORDS` / `READ_WORDS` (and Composio slug verbs) to pick a grade.
  English is infinite, so that list was guaranteed to miss — _pay, charge,
  refund, approve, merge, publish_ were never on it — and its existence is what
  stopped anyone from auditing the labels. No code path concludes anything from
  a tool's name anymore.

  **Only facts grade a tool**, in priority order: a human (`overrides.json`), the
  AI judge (which reads the handler source and quotes its evidence), then
  protocol facts that are true by definition — HTTP `DELETE` is `destructive`, a
  declared GraphQL/tRPC `mutation` is at least `write`, and Composio's own
  `destructiveHint`/`readOnlyHint` say what they say. A `GET` is **not** a fact
  about reading (GETs that mutate exist) and a `POST` is not a fact about
  writing (search endpoints post).

  **⚠️ Breaking behavior: an unjudged catalog now asks on mutations.** Anything
  nothing above graded is the new first-class `ungraded` risk state, and the
  guard's default treatment is to ask — like `destructive`, and at the guard
  level rather than as an init-written rule, so a hand-wired server with no
  policy config at all gets it too. On an install that never ran the AI judge
  this is a real change: tools that used to run silently now park on an approval.
  That is the point — `payInvoice` classified `write` and ran un-gated. Three
  ways forward, and every one of them is a sentence:

  - run `vendo sync` with a model key so the judge grades the catalog;
  - grade the tools you care about by hand in `.vendo/overrides.json`;
  - or decide, in writing, that you accept them:
    `{ "match": { "risk": "ungraded" }, "action": "run" }`.

  `vendo doctor` reports the count plainly (`catalog: 34/61 tools ungraded`,
  code `E-TOOLS-003`), and a keyless `vendo init`/`vendo sync` says what the
  consequence is instead of implying the grades are real.

  **`critical` is now `confirmEach`.** Behavior is unchanged — checked before
  rules, grants, and the judge; none of them can suppress it; every call earns
  its own input-bound, single-use approval. The old name read as a severity rung
  and it is not one: the grade is a _fact_ about the action (a payment is a
  `write`), while `confirmEach` is _governance_ — who must be present. They are
  orthogonal, which is why a data export can be `read` + `confirmEach` and a bulk
  archive can be `destructive` without it. Host-authored files
  (`overrides.json`, `judgments.json`, `.vendo/tools.json`) accept `critical:` as
  a read alias indefinitely; every writer emits `confirmEach`. In TypeScript,
  `ToolDescriptor.critical` becomes `ToolDescriptor.confirmEach` and
  `decidedBy: "critical"` becomes `decidedBy: "confirmEach"`.

  **A standing denial means a person said no.** An ask that re-issues the same
  call id is answered by the user's earlier no instead of minting a new card — but
  only when a _human_ wrote it: an abandoned chat turn, a timed-out embed, and the
  TTL sweep reap the pending row and let the next issue ask again. A person's no
  also voids any unconsumed yes still sitting on the same call, and a decision can
  be taken back with `guard.approvals.revoke(id, principal)` / `DELETE
/approvals/:id` (the mirror of `grants.revoke`). Taking a decision back and
  replaying an approval are the same one-time transition, so a call can never both
  run and be voided — a take-back that arrives after the call was already
  authorized answers `conflict` rather than reporting success. `Guard` grows one
  optional method for the block that spends a yes WITHOUT replaying its call
  (automations arms a standing grant from it): `spendApproval(id, principal)`
  contends on that same transition and answers `spent` / `already-spent` /
  `taken-back`. Custom Guards are unaffected — callers feature-detect it, exactly
  like `abandonApprovals`.

  Three known limits, all written down at the code that carries them. The receipt
  is the only atomic step: an approval ROW has no guarded write (the store offers
  `atomic` for threads, apps and generic rows only), so every marker on it is a
  read followed by a write and something can move the row in between. Because the
  transition winner is settled before any row write, the worst that costs you is a
  stale marker — never an execution, since the transition a call would need is
  already spent. And a custom `Guard` that does not implement the optional
  `spendApproval` puts the automations grant mint back on that read-then-write
  footing, where a revoke landing in the window can lose to the mint; the guard
  that ships here has the seam. Third: when an automation's parked run resumes, its
  standing grant is written just before the call and taken back if the call is not
  authorized after all — every outcome the process lives through, a thrown one
  included, but a hard kill in between leaves that grant behind and nothing sweeps
  it. It shows up in `grants.list`, pinned to the tool's `descriptorHash`,
  app-bound and away-only, and you can revoke it.

  One consequence worth knowing: `descriptorHash` follows the field rename, so
  approvals and grants persisted before the upgrade no longer match their tool's
  new hash. They lapse into a re-ask, which is the fail-closed direction.

- 0197470: Reading a file off a sandbox is part of the seam, not each adapter's private
  business.

  `SandboxMachine.files` — `read`, `write`, `list` — is now declared on the public
  interface in `@vendoai/apps`. It already existed three times with an identical
  shape, hidden behind `satisfies SandboxMachine & Record<string, unknown> as
SandboxMachine` casts in the e2b and Vendo Cloud adapters and on the fake, and
  was missing entirely from two other test doubles: five private spellings (or
  absences) of one contract, on the seam a built app's SOURCE has to cross.

  The interface now states the answers all of them have to agree on:

  - `read` REJECTS for a path the box does not hold — never empty bytes, because a
    silently empty source file is a lost app.
  - `write` creates or replaces the whole file and creates the directories on the
    way to it. It never appends.
  - `list` is ONE level and names only: entries directly in `dir`, a subdirectory
    as its own name, never a path and never recursive. It rejects for a directory
    the box does not hold, exactly as `read` does.
  - `read` hands bytes back UNCHANGED — no text decode, no BOM strip, no
    line-ending normalization — because box content is untrusted and the layer
    above verifies it against the hash in the app's row.

  The shared conformance suite (`@vendoai/apps/adapter-conformance`) pins all of
  it in one leg that every adapter runs, so no provider can drift. Verified live
  against a real e2b sandbox, including a payload of NULs, bare CRs and invalid
  UTF-8.

  The consolidation paid for itself immediately: a review found that the
  in-memory `list` treated the root's prefix as `""` rather than `"/"`, so it
  sliced nothing off an absolute path and dropped every name as blank — `list("/")`
  answered `[]` on a box full of files. Before `inMemoryBoxFiles` that line existed
  in every fake that had a `list` and would have been a separate fix in each. It
  was one fix in one file, and the conformance suite now pins the root case for
  every implementation.

  Two further disagreements the promotion exposed, both invisible while `files` was
  private: the Vendo Cloud list route answers deeper than one level, so the Cloud
  adapter folds the depth away at the seam; and a missing directory rejected on
  real e2b (`[not_found] lstat …`) while both in-memory fakes answered `[]`,
  which is how a mistyped source directory reads as an app with no files. The
  seam now rejects everywhere.

  What went away: two redundant `files` casts on the real adapters, the
  `files`-shaped half of the Cloud wire test's private-surface cast, the
  `files` cast in three live bootstraps, and three copies of the fakes'
  in-memory file semantics (now one `inMemoryBoxFiles`). `SandboxMachineLike` in
  `@vendoai/harnesses/claude-code` carries `files`, still structurally and
  without widening the subpath's imports. `exec` stays adapter-private.

- 798b618: The screen agent: `vendo_make` starts in a cheap assembly loop, and the conductor
  is what it falls through to.

  Every request for something to look at used to go straight into the generation
  conductor — a plan call, a fill worker per group, and the checking layer's two fix
  rounds — whether the ask was a full app or one number on a card. Now the seam
  routes: a lean loop assembles the document itself, and escalates when it cannot.

  **The loop** (`screenAgent()` / `assembleScreen` in `@vendoai/harnesses`) is the
  same `startTurn` call `vendo()` and `instant()` drive, with a small loadout and a
  tight budget:

  - **Assembly tools only.** The verbs by name (`search_components`, `validate`,
    `vendo_apps_data_list`, `vendo_apps_open`, `ask_user`) unioned with the host's
    `read`-risk tools. No mutating host tool, no build tool, and `vendo_make` itself
    is withheld — the screen agent is what it calls.
  - **The host's own declared result shapes** ride the brief, off
    `ToolListing.outputSchema`, so field names are known before any query runs.
  - **The shipped job description**, reused: `buildingAppsSkill` and its
    `references/format.md`, plus one short block correcting what is different here
    (no disk, no delegation, two files, one door out). There is no third prompt.
  - **`SCREEN_STEPS = 10`.** An ask that needs more than that is an ask for a build.
  - **No new write path and no new paint path.** It writes `app.vendo` through the
    workspace and the render seam's `commit()` proxy paints it, exactly as the
    `claudeCode()` harness already builds apps.

  **Escalation** (`escalate`) writes `plan.vendo` and hands the ask on. The plan's
  skeleton paints in seconds and becomes the build's first frame — no consent step,
  one plain sentence, the work proceeds. `AppsRuntime.create` now accepts a
  caller-minted `appId` so the escalated plan and the build that finishes it land on
  one app and one view stream instead of two.

  **The routing is an adapter slot, and it is default-safe.** `AppsConfig.screen`
  takes core's new `ScreenAssembler`; composition is the only place that fills it
  (`apps.experimentalScreenAgent: true`, host config only). `vendo_make` falls
  through to `conductCreate` unchanged on every other answer — an escalation, an
  assembler that could not run, one that threw, and an `assembled` that left no app
  row behind. That last check is what makes the promise true rather than intended:
  the row is the truth, so a screen agent that saved bytes nobody can render costs a
  request nothing.

  Screens run unsandboxed, by design: a description is data, its props are
  schema-validated, and the kit treats them as inert.

  New in `@vendoai/core`: `ScreenAssembler`, `ScreenRequest`, `ScreenOutcome`.
  Edits go through the conductor as before — routing them needs the app's checkout
  projection, which is not this change.

- 8132329: A served app is reached through one checked door, and `experimentalServedApps` is
  gone.

  **The flip.** `open()` on a served (layer-3) app answered the OWNER with the
  sandbox provider's raw public ingress URL, and only a non-owner with this
  deployment's authenticated proxy URL. That owner URL is a bearer-by-obscurity
  capability: it carries no per-request check, so it keeps working for anyone it
  reaches — a shared screen, a copied link, a log line, a pasted bug report — and it
  outlives the grant, the revoke, and the app. Every served app is now answered with
  the proxy URL, which re-checks `can(viewer)` against live rows on every request
  and wakes the machine only after that check passes. The provider-URL leg is
  deleted, not left standing: there is no second way to reach a served app.

  Theme parity is kept — the proxy forwards `?vendoTheme=` into the box, so a served
  app renders in the host's brand exactly as before.

  **BREAKING: `AppsConfig.experimentalServedApps` and `apps.experimentalServedApps`
  are removed.** Layer 3 was never a capability a flag could grant on its own: it is
  a narrowing of layer 2. Delete the option — a host that passes it now fails to
  typecheck. `experimentalMachines` is unchanged and still required.

  What gates a served app instead, all of it already load-bearing:

  - **A machine to serve it.** `served` is derived as a narrowing of `box` in
    `laneGates`, so no sandbox or no `experimentalMachines` means no served lane —
    the relationship is the shape of the expression rather than two flags that have
    to agree with each other at composition time.
  - **A door to serve it through.** `laneGates` also requires `servedProxyPath`, so
    a deployment whose wire is not mounted hears "this host cannot serve its own web
    pages for an app" as a plain `<Cannot>` line in the plan, before a machine is
    built and a surface flipped to something no caller can open. The umbrella fills
    that seam from its own base path, so a `createVendo()` host has it already.
  - **An absolute origin.** The proxy URL must be absolute for a caller that is not
    already on this origin, so serving an app needs `VENDO_BASE_URL` — the same
    variable machine provisioning already requires.
  - **The surface flip's own two signals**, untouched: the plan asked to be served,
    and the host itself fetched `GET /` and got a real page. A box that self-declares
    a served surface on a layer-2 plan is still refused, loudly, and the tree keeps
    serving.
  - **Permission, first.** `edit()` on a served app no longer carries a flag
    refusal; what comes first is `can(editor)`, and an already-provisioned machine is
    never gated by the layer-2 flag — only new graduation and provisioning are.

  Removed with it: `servedAppsDisabledError`, the `servedThroughProxy` predicate
  (and the duplicate access read it did behind `open()`'s own check), the
  `ServedSurface.enabled` mirror, and the composition-time
  `experimentalServedApps requires experimentalMachines` refusal — six concepts out,
  one expression in.

- 14e8246: A team-shared file now reaches the `claudeCode()` sandbox — and its edits come home.

  Orgs, teams and sharing shipped, and the sandbox harness never learned. On
  `claudeCode()` a file in an `/orgs/<org>` mount was invisible: "update our team's
  Quarterly Report app" answered that it does not exist, or built a personal
  duplicate. Worse, when a path did reach the box, the edit was filtered out on the
  way back — the agent said "done" and the write was dropped with no error
  anywhere. The same ask on `vendo()` worked, because the in-process façade asked
  `can()` and the sandbox path asked a hardcoded table of two mount prefixes.

  Permission on the sandbox path is now the workspace's, per file:

  - `WorkspaceFs.canCommit(path)` (new) answers "may this caller land a write
    here?" against LIVE rows — the same question `commit()` already asked itself
    per staged path. `/host` and anything outside the caller's mounts answer false;
    inside `/orgs/<org>/apps/<appId>/**` the app's own grants decide.
  - Checkout materializes every visible file and marks it read-only per FILE, so a
    viewer-level team app lands read-only beside an editable one and the model
    meets the refusal when it reaches for the file — not after rewriting it.
  - Sync-back re-asks the same question against live rows for writes and for
    deletions, so a grant revoked mid-session bites, and one refused org path can
    never take the caller's own work down with it.
  - A team app's `plan.vendo`/`app.vendo` are watched mid-turn like a personal
    app's, so its skeleton paints during the turn instead of at the end.

  `@vendoai/apps` is in this bump because the box door it publishes
  (`box/turn-routes.mjs`, the `./box-door` export, shipped in the machine image)
  carries the other half: its whole-tree and by-shape walks used to answer about
  `/user/` only, so a team file's edit was left on the box's disk. A new
  `@vendoai/harnesses` against an old `@vendoai/apps` is this bug again — the two
  must move together.

  For hosts this is additive: `WorkspaceFs` is produced by
  `workspaceStore(store).open(...)` and consumed, never implemented — the new
  method only widens what you can call on the workspace you already hold.

- 6a3d9e3: refactor(apps)!: the brain dies — one router, one builder, zero middlemen

  `AppsRuntime.create` and `AppsRuntime.edit` no longer run a generation pipeline.
  They run the SAME engine `vendo_make` runs: the screen assembler in the
  `apps.screen` slot. "The seam routes, not the caller" was never a `vendo_make`
  property — it is the runtime's, and now every caller behind it (the HTTP wire,
  the React client, a seed script) gets it.

  - **`create`** asks the assembler first. `assembled` → the row it stored is the
    answer. `escalate` → the plan it wrote is the build's whole brief.
    `unavailable`, a throw, or an unfilled slot → an honest failure that says so.
  - **`edit`** is the assembler opening the app's own `app.vendo`, rewriting it and
    saving it; the save lands through `AppsRuntime.authored`, so the store write,
    the checks floor and the paint are the shipped ones. An `escalate` on an
    existing app is the escalation ladder — an automation, or a box.
  - **The machine lane briefs itself from the plan.** `<Server kind="steps" |
"agentic" | "box" [served]>` is the escalating agent's own declaration and
    nothing re-derives it; a plan that escalated with no `<Server>` defaults to
    `kind="box"`, because the escalation is itself the claim that assembly cannot
    serve the ask. The in-box task carries the plan text verbatim, the person's ask
    verbatim, and the app's memory.

  ## Breaking

  - **`apps.fill` (`{ model }`) is gone**, and so is the fast fill tier it named:
    the group fill workers it pointed at do not exist any more. `createVendo`'s
    `models.fill` seat (and its deprecated `paint.model` predecessor) are still
    accepted and validated, and are now **ignored** — nothing reads them — so a host
    config does not have to change in the same release. **Migration:** delete
    `apps: { fill: … }` from a direct `createApps(...)` composition, and drop
    `models.fill` / `paint` from `createVendo(...)` at your convenience. Nothing
    replaces them: there is one generation seat (`apps.model` / `models.default`),
    plus whatever the assembler's own harness uses.
  - **`apps.screen` is required for `create` and `edit`, not only for `vendo_make`.**
    A deployment that composes `@vendoai/apps` without a `ScreenAssembler` now fails
    those doors loudly instead of quietly serving them from a second engine.
    `createVendo` fills the slot for you.
  - `UNSTORED_APP_ID` is no longer exported from `@vendoai/apps`.
  - An app row's `session` (the brain's transcript) is no longer written or read.
    Existing rows are unaffected until their next write, which drops it. An app's
    memory (`remember`) is what carries intent forward.

  ## Deleted

  `generation/conductor.ts`, `generation/brain.ts`, `generation/fill.ts`,
  `generation/prompts/`, `generation/contracts/sections.ts`, the island lane and
  `laneGates` in `generation/lanes.ts`, `growSkeleton` / `spliceFragment` /
  `Skeleton.slots`, `FIX_ROUNDS`, the commit-gate lead paragraphs, and the session
  plumbing. `skeletonFromPlan` stays — it is the live plan-paint path at the render
  seam.

- fbf265b: A turn, a beat and a screen each say what they are — plus an app's code moves
  into its row.

  **`Turn.turnId`, and every audit row carries it.** There was no turn id anywhere,
  so an audit row, a mirrored tool call and a painted view could not be joined to
  the exchange they came out of. "Which calls belonged to the turn where the user
  asked for X" was unanswerable from the audit plane — the plane billing and
  reconciliation read. `mintTurnId()` mints `"trn_<32 hex>"`, the runtime stamps it
  where it already builds the `Turn`, and it rides the `RunContext` from that line
  on, so every guarded call, audit row and painted view downstream is joinable
  without a new parameter on fifteen signatures. Opaque to adapters. Additive for
  hosts: `RunContext.turnId` and `AuditEvent.turnId` are optional, and absent means
  "no turn", never "unknown turn".

  **Beats.** `HarnessEvent`'s `status` member gains an optional `phase`
  (`"understanding" | "planning" | "assembling" | "building" | "checking" |
"finishing"` — closed at six) and an optional `appId`. The union itself stays
  closed at four members, because adding one is a breaking change for every host
  renderer and widening one is not. A harness that yields only `label` puts the
  identical transient `data-vendo-status` chunk on the wire it always did.

  **`ScreenDescription`.** The view channel carried `UIPayload` —
  `{ formatVersion: string; [key: string]: unknown }` — an open bag whose seven real
  fields were read by inline cast at each consumer, so a deployed host frontend had
  nothing to hold us to. The fields are now declared and versioned, and the render
  seam GATES on them: what it compiles must parse or nothing paints, which is the
  law that seam already lived by for content that does not compile. The schema
  refuses `data` outright — a description says what to fetch, never what came back
  — so that law is enforceable rather than written down.

  **`AppDocument.source`.** An app's code had three homes: island TSX in
  `components`, the wire surface in workspace file rows, and — for a served app —
  only inside the sandbox snapshot behind `machine.snapshotRef`. Lose the snapshot
  and the customer's app was gone, because the store never had it. `source` maps
  POSIX-relative paths to `AppSourceFile { hash, bytes, text?, blobRef? }`, inline
  up to `WORKSPACE_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (which moves to `@vendoai/core`, where its two
  readers can both see one answer) and blob-spilled past it through the SAME
  `FilesAdapter` the workspace rows already spill to. `machine.snapshotRef` becomes
  a cache: an app can always be rebuilt from its row.

  `checkoutApp` / `commitApp` in `@vendoai/apps` make a workspace a working copy of
  that row — checkout projects the document onto a filesystem, commit diffs the
  changed paths back. The two hot paths (`app.vendo`, `plan.vendo`) stay the render
  seam's, `trigger` travels untouched through every path, and a source key that
  would escape the app's directory is refused by the document validator.

  All additive for hosts: every new field is optional, every schema stays
  `.passthrough()`, and rows written before this keep parsing unchanged.

- 38a840d: `vendo_make` has ONE engine. Assembly that produces no screen is the answer.

  `ScreenOutcome.unavailable` used to fall through to the conductor, and so did an
  unwired assembler, an assembler that threw, and an `assembled` that left no app
  row behind. All four now end the ask with a FAILED `MakeReceipt` whose `say`
  names what happened — the assembler's own `why` verbatim where there is one.

  A quiet fall-through is how a composition bug ships: a deployment that forgot to
  fill `apps.screen`, or whose assembler is broken, read all-green while every ask
  was served by an engine nobody chose. It reads as broken now.

  `escalate` is unchanged — it is a request for the builder, not the seam failing,
  and a deployment with a sandbox still runs the build at the same app id.

  **Migration**

  - **`apps.screen` is required for `vendo_make`.** `createVendo()` fills it; a host
    composing `@vendoai/apps` directly must pass a `ScreenAssembler` or `vendo_make`
    will answer `status: "failed"` on every new-app request. `AppsRuntime.create`
    and `AppsRuntime.edit` are unaffected and still generate.
  - **`conductCreate`, `conductEdit`, `ConductedApp`, `ConductedResult` and
    `ConductorOptions` are no longer exported from `@vendoai/apps`.** They were
    public for "external bench harnesses"; a reverse-dependency walk found no
    caller in this repo, the examples, the corpus harness or the docs. The pipeline
    still runs inside `createApps()` — it just has no public surface to be extended
    through.
  - `generationPromptSections` (internal, `generation/contracts/sections.ts`) is
    deleted: no caller, and a second unmaintained description of the v2 tree
    contract is worse than none.

- a0dbfc6: The agent can now be told who the user is and what they are looking at.

  Two seams, both optional, both merged into one `[Situation]` block on every
  message the user sends:

  - **User facts.** The `user` resolver on the `authJs()` and `jwt()` auth presets
    may now return a `facts` object alongside the principal, and those facts reach
    the prompt. The session is decoded once per request for both the principal and
    the facts. An anonymous request resolves no facts.
  - **Live screen context.** `useVendoContext(data)` publishes structured host data
    for as long as the component is mounted, and retires it on unmount. Several
    mounted callers coexist and merge. `VendoProvider` also takes `captureScreen`
    (default `true`) to control the screen snapshot that rides the same channel.

  **BREAKING (`@vendoai/ui`, `@vendoai/vendo/react`): `useVendoContext` is now
  `useVendoProvider`.** The name `useVendoContext` previously belonged to the
  zero-argument hook that read everything `VendoProvider` supplies; it now belongs
  to the host-facing hook above, which takes data and returns nothing. Both names
  still exist, so the compiler is the thing that catches this:

  ```diff
  - const { client } = useVendoContext();
  + const { client } = useVendoProvider();
  ```

  Because both names still exist, the compiler catches this rather than the
  runtime: an existing zero-argument call now fails with `TS2554: Expected 1
arguments, but got 0`. Rename the call and you are done — nothing else about the
  provider value changed.

- 39a7ecc: **Both writers get a design brief.** The screen agent and the `claudeCode()`
  builder could name every component in the catalog and had nothing to say about
  WHICH one, HOW MANY, or WHERE — so a screen was whatever the model reached for
  first.

  **The design law ships inside the skill.** `buildingAppsSkill` gains a
  `## What a good screen looks like` section, written in `.vendo` terms rather than
  CSS, because every one of these is a choice made in the plan: lead with the
  answer, fewer parts and better ones, never say the same thing twice, bind the
  rows as they come, group by what the person came to do, `col` is width and never
  slicing, pick the chart by the shape of the data, a hole is a `<Cannot>`, the
  words are the host's own, and an `<Island>` styles with the theme's CSS variables
  and nothing else. One text, in the skill BOTH writers read, so `claudeCode()` and
  the screen agent cannot be taught different design.

  **The host's theme and design rules now reach both writers.** `apps.designRules`
  and the theme tokens are documented seams a host sets and expects to be obeyed.
  They reached the fill worker of the retired conductor and nothing else — so on
  both live write paths those two config keys silently did nothing. The new
  `hostDesignBrief` (exported from `@vendoai/apps`) renders that pair ONCE, and
  composition hands the same string to both seams: the screen agent's brief,
  through a `design` slot beside `system` on `ScreenInput` and
  `ScreenAssemblerDeps`, and the composed prompt `claudeCode()` thinks with. The
  slot is a thunk, not a value, so a rules change applies to the next screen rather
  than the next boot.

  Deliberately NOT inside `claudeCode()`: that harness thinks with `turn.system`
  whole and alone and appends nothing after the host's prompt seam, so the prompt
  seam is the only honest place for them.

### Patch Changes

- 2e792a1: Advisory compile issues are advisory at every validation door.

  #906 put ONE floor behind the four doors an app reaches a screen through, but the
  compile issues in FRONT of that floor were still classified twice. The paint seam
  refuses only what did not parse — `compile-failed`, `missing-app` — while
  `validateCompiledCreate` turned EVERY wire issue into a block.

  They disagreed on `wire-id-ignored`, which is not a code a model has to invent:
  `checkoutApp` writes an app's own `app.vendo` with
  `printWire(…, { includeIds: true })`, so every element of a checked-out app carries
  an id the compiler then ignores. The seam painted those bytes and
  `validate({ document })` refused them — the door the assembly loop is told to call
  "the floor" answering "does not pass" over our own printer's output. PR #913
  measured it and deliberately left it.

  Core now names the one classification the doors share
  (`isAdvisoryWireIssue` / `WIRE_ADVISORY_ISSUE_CODES`), and the create and edit
  validators read it instead of blocking on every issue. Nothing else moves: an
  issue that drops something the author actually wrote still blocks everywhere, and
  the paint seam's own parse gate is untouched.

- 3f98372: **Apps remember what they were asked for.** A screen or build run is stateless,
  so the ARTIFACT now carries its own context: `AppDocument` gains an additive
  `memory` of two parts.

  - **`asks`** — every `vendo_make` request that touched this app, VERBATIM and in
    order, the create ask first. Never a paraphrase (a paraphrase drifts the intent
    it exists to preserve) and never the `<context>`-fenced composite an engine is
    briefed with: the memory holds what the PERSON said, so one calling agent's
    background for one call cannot become a standing requirement.
  - **`decisions`** — a short block the agent writes through `save_app`'s new
    optional `decisions` field: choices made, constraints found, things ruled out.
    REPLACED on every run that writes one, never appended, because a superseded
    decision presented as a current one is worse than no memory at all.

  Both are read back where the next editor actually reads: the edit brain's brief
  OPENS with the memory, ahead of the document, and the in-box builder's task
  context does the same. Without it an editor meets a deliberately filtered list
  and "fixes" it.

  Server-written throughout. `AppsRuntime.remember` is the one door that writes
  memory (`editor`-gated); a model-authored `memory` is stripped from a generated
  document, and an edit pins the stored one. Caps live at that write site rather
  than in the schema — the last 20 asks, 1KB of decisions — so a stored row
  survives a cap that changes. Reasoning traces, transcripts and tool outputs are
  deliberately not stored.

- f884bfe: Closes the two gaps behind #822's defect 1 (the canonical "compare weather in
  three cities" dashboard failing persistently on the BYO default model):

  - **The brain's direct-mode prompt now teaches the wire's real constraints.**
    `brainPrompt` had almost no dialect-syntax teaching for a direct (single-shot)
    answer — the fill-worker prompt had it, but a "tiny ask" never reaches a
    worker. The model reached for JS idioms the wire rejects: a method-call tool
    name (`cities.map`, `Math.round`), braces as text interpolation, and a loop
    variable with no declared query behind it. `brainPrompt`'s rules now say so
    explicitly, and that a fixed small set of named rows reads by array
    position off its query, never a loop.
  - **A direct answer that fails to compile now gets a retry.** `conductCreate`
    had a fix-it loop for every other outcome (`checkAndFix`, bounded at
    `FIX_ROUNDS`) except this one: a direct answer with ANY compile mistake
    (unknown tool, braces-in-text, an undeclared reference) returned
    `kind: "failure"` on the very first try, with no chance to self-heal from
    the compiler's own message. It now retries up to `FIX_ROUNDS` times, feeding
    the brain its own wire and exactly what was wrong with it — the same
    teaching-sentence discipline `fixInstruction` already uses.
  - **The wire's "unknown-reference" issue now names the declared queries**, the
    same way "unknown tool" already lists the real tools — a retry (from either
    fix above) gets something to pick from instead of guessing again.

- d6f5e28: Follow-up to #823: with the JS-idiom mistakes gone, "expected a single <App
  ...>...</App> element" became the dominant direct-mode failure — the model's
  answer wasn't wrapped in exactly one root `<App>` element. `brainPrompt` now
  states that rule explicitly, quoting the wire compiler's own error text, and
  the direct-mode retry loop's own instruction repeats it for the retry
  specifically. This failure was already reaching `conductCreate`'s #823 retry
  loop like any other compile issue (confirmed by test) — the gap was purely
  that nothing taught the model the rule in the first place.
- e6aaa7a: Two generation-hardening fixes, both aimed at a model correcting itself instead
  of an app failing outright:

  - **The `.data` envelope binding miss now names the fix.** When a binding reads
    a field that is actually one level down, under the tool's own `data` field
    (`sum(accounts, "balance")` where `accounts` is `{ data: [...] }`), the fact
    check's "the real fields are: data" message now also says which path to use
    instead (`accounts.data.balance`) — the fix-it retry gets the exact
    correction rather than just the shape.
  - **The plan's own vocabulary no longer leaks into a shipped app as an unknown
    component.** A worker filling a group, or the brain writing a whole app in
    one shot, occasionally copies the PLAN's own wrapper syntax
    (`<Leaf component="Stat" query="..." purpose="...">`, `<Group>`) verbatim
    into the markup it writes. `skeleton.ts`'s `withoutPlanVocabulary` already
    stripped `query`/`purpose` off a fill fragment's props; it now also resolves
    a stray `<Leaf component="X">` to the `X` it names and a stray `<Group>` to
    the `Stack` it always meant, and the same pass now also runs on the DIRECT
    create path (`validateCompiledCreate`), which has no fill fragment and
    previously had no defence against this at all.

- ab5d181: A READ through the app door takes the query arm, so an approved read's refetch
  lands.

  `apps.call` handed every call to `caller.call` — the arm with a random uuid per
  invocation. The guard's approved replay PINS the call id, so an ungraded read
  that parked on an approval could never be satisfied: approve, refetch, new id,
  park again, forever. It never surfaced because a `.vendo` screen's reads go
  through `createProgressiveQueryResolver`, which already calls `callQuery`;
  `apps.call` is the only door a code-land app (`@vendoai/kit`'s `useToolQuery`)
  has, so the wrong arm became reachable the moment code-land shipped.

  A call whose tool is graded `read` now takes `caller.callQuery`, whose id is
  derived from (app, tool, args) — exactly a query's identity. The discriminator is
  the tool's own authored risk grade, which is the server's existing classification
  of what a call does, so nothing new has to be declared and no second route
  appears. Every other grade (including `ungraded`) keeps the action arm: two
  identical mutations are two separate acts and each has to earn its own approval.

- d1ff923: The generation prompt's TOOL RESPONSE SHAPES section now teaches that a money
  field a host already signs (a credit or other liability account's balance
  arrives negative) sums AS-IS across every row a total is meant to cover —
  never filtered out by account kind, never wrapped in `Math.abs()`, and never
  manually subtracted via a second query. Follow-up to #818's root-cause
  investigation: the sign was always the data's own, never a hint any code
  change could touch, but the model had no explicit instruction ruling out
  filtering, `Math.abs()`, or a hand-rolled subtraction instead of trusting it.

### Patch Changes

- a2bd192: A Claude 5 model pinned through the model ladder can generate again (#692).

  `vendoModel()`'s lazy wrapper reports its family id (`"vendo-env"`) by design,
  so model-params' Claude 5 allowlist never saw the resolved rung's real id: the
  engine's `temperature: 0` rode through the ladder and a pinned Claude 5 model
  (`VENDO_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) rejected every call
  with 400 "`temperature` is deprecated for this model". Sampling support is now
  re-decided at call time against the RESOLVED rung — the one moment the real id
  is known — dropping the sampling params such a rung rejects and setting the
  explicit output cap that guards against a sampling-era provider's silent 4096
  truncation. Sampling-era Claude and non-Claude rungs pass through untouched.
  `@vendoai/apps` exports the capability rule (`acceptsSamplingParams`,
  `UNKNOWN_MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`) so the umbrella rides the engine's one
  allowlist instead of a copy.

  - @vendoai/core@0.6.1

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ae3d13: Delete template tool descriptions and the domains manifest.

  `vendo sync` no longer invents a description for a tool your API does not
  describe. The deterministic `"Use this to …"` generator is gone: an
  undescribed tool carries `""` in `.vendo/tools.json`, which is the honest
  keyless state. Sync's AI enrichment pass proposes real descriptions when a
  model credential is present, and `overrides.json → tools[name].description`
  still wins forever.

  The domains manifest is gone end to end. Generation already receives the full
  tool list, so a derived summary of tool nouns told the model nothing new — and
  a finite `hasNot` can never enumerate what a host lacks. Removed: the `domains`
  field from both `.vendo/tools.json` and `.vendo/overrides.json`, the
  `DATA DOMAINS` prompt section, and the `domains` provider slot on the apps
  runtime.

  Removed public API: `DomainManifest` and `domainManifestSchema` (from
  `@vendoai/core`); the `domains` field on `ToolsFile` / `OverridesFile`;
  `createApps({ domains })`. `mergedSemanticsAndDomains` is now
  `mergedHostSemantics` and returns the per-tool semantics record directly
  (the `MergedHostSemantics` wrapper type is gone).

  `.vendo/overrides.json` is strict, so a leftover `domains` key now fails
  loudly at parse — delete it and re-run `vendo sync`.

- a7199db: Chrome polish wave + the automation card's missing emitter.

  - **Status ribbon docks onto the composer** (Codex-style): narrower than the
    composer, top corners only, its bottom edge tucked behind the card — no more
    floating pill with a gap, on both the page surface and the overlay's
    dock-anchor DOM.
  - **Approval card de-escalated**: the ceremony card keeps the neutral surface
    with a single amber accent bar instead of the full yellow wash; the
    ALL-CAPS "CRITICAL" eyebrow is gone; risk slugs render in the user's
    language ("Irreversible", "Makes changes", "Read-only") with the raw slug
    intact on `data-risk` and the tooltip.
  - **App-card dot stands down when ready**: the pulsing build dot fades and
    collapses once the view is generated; the ready bar carries just the name.
  - **`.fl-btn` is a non-wrapping flex row**: icon + label ride one line (the
    connect card's "Connecting…" spinner no longer folds onto its own line).
  - **`VendoPage` accepts `thread`** (`suggestions` + `discoverability`
    passthrough to the chat tab), so hosts can move their curated landing onto
    the full workspace; Maple's Ask Maple page and Cadence's assistant now
    render the workspace console.
  - **The automation card now actually streams**: `vendo_apps_edit` ok-outputs
    that armed an automation emit `data-vendo-automation` from the agent tool
    bridge (name-scoped, 01 §16), and the apps runtime reports the armed
    trigger's true `enabled` state on `EditResult.automation`. The playground
    gallery gains an "Automation created" scenario.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f95feb7: Runtime/generation wave: `apps.pipeline` threading through createVendo, `agent.instructions` host-voice seam, per-instance judge model binding (bindVendoModelSlots — the process-level slot registry is gone; `Judge.model` is now part of the guard's Judge contract), island-scoped repair + concurrent tier-0 paint lane with a monotonic partial gate, region-parallel assembly compiling the production inline-reference dialect, smoke-render environment failures skipping instead of failing apps, no-emoji contract rules, and per-lane generation logging (onTiming/onPipeline wired to the operator console).

### Patch Changes

- 0b58e3e: Generation now rejects capability substitution: a mutating host tool invoked with a hand-typed target or amount is sent back to repair instead of shipped. The live defect this closes had a generated island calling `host_transferMoney({ amount: 1, recipient_name: 'Slack Forwarding Bot', memo: 'APPROVED TRANSACTIONS: …' })` on a host with no messaging tool — a payments API used as a message channel, with a real side effect. The rule is mechanical (argument provenance, not intent matching): operands that arrive through tool data, user input, form state, or a row the user acted on always pass; the values the user themselves named in their request always pass; enums, flags and consts a tool declares never trip it. Both surfaces are covered — declarative action payloads and `tools.*` calls in island source. When the host lacks the capability, the honest disclaimer path is the only valid answer.
- 0e3bc0a: Generation works on the Claude 5 model line. The engine hardcoded `temperature: 0` at every model call, but Claude Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 (and Opus 4.7/4.8) removed the sampling parameters and reject the request outright with `400 — "\`temperature\` is deprecated for this model."`, so a host configuring any of those models could not generate at all. Sampling is now capability-gated on the model id: temperature is dropped only where the model rejects it and `temperature: 0`is preserved everywhere else. The same gate sets an explicit output cap on those ids, so a host whose`@ai-sdk/anthropic`predates the 5 line can no longer silently fall back to`max_tokens: 4096` and truncate a generated app mid-wire.
- f965d77: A create whose document generated cleanly no longer loses the whole turn when the store refuses to persist it. The final view part was emitted _after_ `apps.put`, so a rejected write took the settling emit with it: every streamed card froze on whatever mid-stream payload it last held (a half-painted chart, an empty-state table) with no way to tell a frozen card from a genuinely empty one, the create tool answered the agent with a bare error, and the agent apologized and rebuilt the same app twice more — three cards for one prompt, none of them saved, nothing logged on the user path. Live on the deployed Maple demo, whose Cloud store was rejecting every `vendo_apps` write.

  Now the finished view is emitted before anything that can fail, a failed persist degrades the app to view-only instead of discarding it, and the failure is named in the operator log (`app not saved (<id>): the view rendered but the store rejected it`, plus `(NOT SAVED)` on the completion line) and handed to the agent as an `unsaved` note on an `ok` result — so it states the one true thing and stops, instead of apologizing for a view the user can see. Escalation is skipped for an unsaved app, since every rung writes through the same store. Separately, a query that resolves non-ok now warns once instead of silently rendering an empty card.

- 280a142: Generation repair now repoints an array-expecting prop that landed on a `{ data: [...] }` wrapper object, instead of regenerating the whole app. Live on the Maple demo, the most obvious prompt ("Show my spending by category") never rendered: the model bound the donut's `slices` array prop to the spending tool's ROOT object, validation correctly rejected it (`expected an array, the bound field is object`), and — because a kind mismatch is not a compile _binding_ error — structured repair's closed fix space was empty, so every attempt paid a full-lane regeneration. When the bound object holds exactly ONE top-level array, repair now derives the nested path and splices it with no model call; ambiguous shapes (zero or 2+ arrays) keep today's behavior. Any host returning an envelope instead of a bare array hit this.

  `vendo sync` also records a host's DECLARED response body: an OpenAPI 2xx `application/json` schema becomes `outputSchema` on the `.vendo/tools.json` entry (refs resolved), so the envelope a host returns is part of the committed contract rather than something the model infers. Nothing is invented when the spec is silent.

## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- 9f01a92: Two fixes from the first full init→app-generated e2e on real workerd:
  the island TSX validator's esbuild import is now bundler-blind (Wrangler
  inlined the Node-only package into Worker bundles, where its \_\_filename
  crash was misread as "invalid TSX" and failed EVERY app build — the field
  report's apps-create death), and a validator that crashes at runtime now
  degrades to no validation instead of failing every island. The CLI also
  accepts `--framework custom` (the flag whitelist had missed it; only the
  programmatic path worked).
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.8

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- fd9260d: Empty-states batch — a fresh install's FIRST generated app now renders well
  with no bindable host data. Generation always emits the requested component
  bound to its tool (the Kit renders the designed empty state) instead of
  omitting it or writing prose into a tile; the no-data explanation is one
  consolidated "About this view" note, charts route to the Kit, and the app
  name is a <=40-char display title (validated on create) instead of the
  request echoed back. The Kit stat tile shows a compact em dash for empty
  values and truncates prose-length text into a tooltip, empty label/value
  pairs render an em dash, and the in-thread app panel scrolls its top into
  view when a live build settles. The create-app tool description also stops
  callers baking pre-computed figures or branding into the prompt.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.7

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 60c5e39: A create_app build can no longer die silently (0.4.5 E2E cert defect D, byo-ai-sdk host). Three layers: a build whose every region was disclaimed away ("This part of the request isn't available on this host.") now fails terminally with an honest host-capability reason instead of persisting as a "successful" app that reads as a build hanging forever; a server-side build watchdog persists a terminal failed record when a build task neither completes nor throws inside its window (VENDO_APP_BUILD_WATCHDOG_MS, default 4 min), so the embed always resolves even if the build promise hangs or is severed by the host runtime; and the embed's build deadline is now an absolute client-side timer with a per-poll timeout, so a hung open() poll can no longer freeze the building beat past the deadline.
  - @vendoai/core@0.4.6

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 31f899e: A chat turn whose app build terminally fails now ENDS, with the classified
  failure reason visible in the thread. Before, the failed build came back as a
  plain error outcome only the model could see: the tray rendered nothing, and
  the model re-ran the minutes-long doomed build inside the same turn until the
  step cap — a thread stuck "streaming" for 10+ minutes with no banner and no
  reason (0.4.4 E2E cert). The agent's tool bridge now streams an additive
  `data-vendo-build-failed` part (toolCallId + the runtime's canned, non-leaky
  reason) beside the failed `vendo_apps_create` result, the agent loop stops the
  turn after the failed build (re-asking is the user's call, matching the BYO
  embed's failed vocabulary), and the thread renders the part as an error beat
  with the reason.

  The generation engine also names an empty model stream as its own failure
  class ("completed without any text output") instead of reporting the empty
  string's wire-parse issues — the 0.4.4 cert's "wire missing-app / empty
  layout" failures were a gateway alias ending turns reasoning-only, not a
  model-format defect, and the old issue list mis-routed that triage.

- 87eadba: fix(venue): e2b is only selectable when actually usable — 0.4.4 regression

  `e2bInstalled()` treated a runtime without `import.meta.resolve` as "the
  bundler inlined the SDK, so it must be available". Inside Turbopack/webpack
  server bundles that fallback always fired, so a stray `E2B_API_KEY` (for
  example inherited from the shell) flipped the venue ladder to an e2b the
  runtime could never load, outranking the Vendo Cloud sandbox and killing
  every server-app build — 0.4.3 printed `execution venue: cloud`, 0.4.4
  printed `e2b` on the same host. The probe now tests usability instead of
  importability: it asks Node's own resolver (`require.resolve` via
  `process.getBuiltinModule`, which works inside server bundles), falls back to
  a real `import.meta.resolve`, and reads an unverifiable runtime as NOT
  installed — the SDK is never bundler-inlined (the mutable-specifier import
  from the edge-portability work guarantees it), so the runtime resolver is the
  only truth. With `VENDO_API_KEY` set and no usable e2b, the venue is the
  Cloud sandbox again.

  `vendo doctor` also stops false-blessing the venue: `execution venue: e2b`
  now passes only when `E2B_API_KEY` is set and the `e2b` package resolves from
  the project; otherwise it fails with E-LIVE-007 and a concrete fix line.

  - @vendoai/core@0.4.5

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 835d17a: Edge-runtime portability: the server entry now bundles and boots on
  Web-standard runtimes (Cloudflare Workers first). Fetch defaults are
  invocation-safe, the optional e2b SDK no longer breaks esbuild/Wrangler
  builds, Node-only legs (local store engines, dev model ladder, telemetry
  disk config, actions sync tooling) sit behind worker/edge export
  conditions with honest guidance, and createVendo performs no I/O, timers,
  or random generation at construction — module-scope wiring works. A CI
  portability gate (bundle + real workerd boot) keeps it that way.

  Note for hosts that reach into composed blocks directly: the BYO tool seam
  (`vendo.guardedTools`, and the ai-sdk/mastra packs built on it) arms schema
  readiness on first execute. Raw `vendo.store`/`vendo.automations` reach-ins
  should `await vendo.store.ensureSchema()` first — the previous eager kick
  only ever gave that pattern a racy head start.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- a48b1b7: Wave 2 runtime fixes from the 0.4.x E2E certification campaign:

  - Mastra shim: open-schema guarded tools (extracted routes whose body shape
    is untyped) no longer execute with `{}` when the user dictated args.
    Mastra's provider schema-compat layers hard-close every object schema for
    strict-mode providers, so an open input reached the model as "takes no
    arguments"; the shim now bridges open inputs through one declared `args`
    property (JSON object or JSON-encoded string) and unwraps it before the
    guard, so approvals park — and replay — with the real arguments.
  - Failed app builds now carry their reason everywhere: `create()` re-throws
    with the classified reason in the message (the tool outcome the calling
    agent reads), logs the un-canned issue list to the operator terminal
    (previously a silent failure), and the app embed shows a retry hint for
    retryable failures. The generation engine now captures streamText's
    swallowed provider errors, so quota/timeout/no-key failures classify
    correctly instead of collapsing to "generation failed".
  - The dev model's no-usable-credential lines (missing provider package, no
    key at all) surface verbatim in the failed-build reason — the in-surface
    error now carries the actionable `npm install @ai-sdk/...` / `vendo login`
    instruction instead of `model could not produce a valid app`.
  - `@vendoai/ui` DonutChart no longer crashes on `undefined`/non-array data
    inside generated apps; it renders the designed empty state like the other
    Kit charts.

### Minor Changes

- 0e94fa6: Secrets egress fetch shim (ENG-290 M4, 06-apps §4.3/§4.5 option B).

  - **In-sandbox fetch shim**: every machine now carries a runtime-owned
    `/app/.vendo/fetch-shim.cjs`, loaded at boot via `NODE_OPTIONS --require` by
    the rung-2/3 boot convention, the rung-4 served-app scaffold's `start.sh`,
    and Modal's create command. Outbound `fetch(externalUrl)` from app code is
    rewritten into `POST {VENDO_PROXY_URL}/egress` authenticated by the run
    token, so plain `fetch` with a declared secret handle in a header or body
    authenticates to allowlisted hosts — substitution stays exclusively at the
    proxy, outside the sandbox. Internal requests (relative URLs, the proxy
    itself, loopback) are never rewritten; a refused egress surfaces as an
    ordinary fetch `TypeError`, never a leak.
  - **Interchange**: `.vendoapp` exports exclude the runtime-owned shim, and
    imports rebuild machines with the current shim (an archive can never smuggle
    a modified one in).
  - Env-gated live lanes prove the shim on real E2B (Modal lane parked on
    missing `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`/`MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`, exactly like the ladder
    lanes).

- 7826a6e: feat(apps): guarded per-secret in-sandbox exposure toggle (ENG-345)

  Adds the off-by-default exception path to the Option B secrets gateway: an
  owner-only, per-secret × per-app toggle that injects a secret's real value into
  the sandbox env instead of a handle. Flipping it on is a high-risk action gated
  by the guard's existing approval flow; every run with an exposed secret emits an
  audit event; and the grant lives outside the app document so it never travels
  with a share, remix, fork, export, or import (copies always revert to handles).

- 8d5423d: Generation speed: add an opt-in `onTiming` seam around `modelEngine.create` (per-lane first-paint / complete timing + token usage) and a best-effort `runtime.prewarm()` page-open model warm-up. Additive — no change to create/paint/render behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 023b3c0: Security hardening (ENG-251).

  - **Run-token anti-replay** (`@vendoai/apps`): run tokens now carry a random `jti`
    nonce. A run's jti is burned when its machine is torn down, so a captured token
    replayed afterwards is rejected at the proxy even though its HMAC and TTL still
    verify — shrinking the replay window from the full 15-minute TTL to the live run.
    A token remains valid for every callback of its own live run (tools, state,
    egress), so legitimate repeated proxy calls are unaffected. A token minted with
    no `jti` fails closed.
  - **Timing-safe `/tick` compare** (`@vendoai/vendo`): the `VENDO_TICK_SECRET`
    bearer check used plain string equality (a timing oracle). It now uses a
    WebCrypto HMAC-digest constant-time compare — edge-safe, no `node:crypto`.
  - **Bounded ephemeral-subject set** (`@vendoai/store`): the anonymous-visitor
    ephemeral-subject set is now a bounded LRU (10k) instead of growing until
    process restart. The subject registered for the current request is never the
    one evicted.

- 7546de1: Inject the standard run environment when `importApp` provisions a machine (ENG-347, 06-apps §4.2).

  Import rebuilt an app-directory machine with `env: { PORT }` only, bypassing the
  shared env helper the create/edit path uses. The secrets egress fetch shim then
  declined to install (it requires `VENDO_PROXY_URL` + `VENDO_RUN_TOKEN`), so an
  imported rung-2/3 app could not reach host tools or the egress endpoint until it
  was re-edited. Provisioning now routes through the machine cache, baking the same
  §4.2 run environment (`PORT`, `VENDO_PROXY_URL`, a freshly minted `VENDO_RUN_TOKEN`,
  and declared secret handles) into the rebuilt snapshot, so an imported app reaches
  tools/egress with no subsequent edit.

- dab84c2: Performance: bound the automations tick and the agent's per-turn context.

  - **automations**: the tick fetches only schedule-triggered apps through an indexed
    `trigger_kind` ref (was a full scan of every app for every subject) and batches every
    schedule cursor into one query (was an N+1 get per app). Fired automations now execute
    with bounded parallelism (`tickConcurrency`, default 4) and an optional per-run timeout
    (`runTimeoutMs`), so one hung run cannot block other tenants or overrun the tick
    interval. `emit` likewise fetches only the subject's host-event apps. `/tick` still
    returns the same runIds.
  - **agent**: Anthropic prompt-caching breakpoints on the static system prompt and the
    stable history prefix (ignored by other providers); a default tool-output cap so one
    huge host-tool response cannot blow the context (`config.agent.toolOutputCap`); a new
    `historyWindow` knob bounding what is re-sent per turn (default: the full thread, as
    before); and thread listing that derives titles from a stored `title` instead of loading
    every thread's full message array.
  - **store**: btree indexes backing the `(created_at, id)` keyset pagination on
    `vendo_records` and the paged MCP tables, a generated `trigger_kind` column on
    `vendo_apps`, and a `title` column on `vendo_threads`. All applied as additive DDL — no
    schema-version bump and no data migration.
