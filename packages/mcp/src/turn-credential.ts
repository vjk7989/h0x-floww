/**
 * 10-mcp §3b — the door's SECOND way in: a credential the host process mints
 * for its own harness, beside the OAuth grants an outside agent arrives with.
 *
 * **Why the door needed one.** The door was built for outside agents, so every
 * RunContext it minted said `venue: "mcp"`, `presence: "present"`, and every
 * approval it hit was answered in-band with "resolve it in the product and
 * retry". A `claudeCode()` box reaching its host's tools over native remote MCP
 * has a live turn behind it — a real venue, a real presence, a real stream to
 * put an approval card on — and losing all of that at the door made the door
 * unusable for it (measured: `packages/vendo/tests/mcp-door-parity.e2e.test.ts`).
 *
 * **The shape, and why it cannot impersonate.** A token states NOTHING. It is an
 * opaque pointer at "the turn currently in flight on thread T", handed out by
 * the process that owns both the door and the harness. There is no subject in
 * it, no scope in it, no venue in it — so there is nothing to forge. Whatever
 * the pointed-at turn could already do is exactly what the credential can do,
 * and the moment no turn of that thread is in flight it resolves to nothing.
 *
 * The door therefore adds NO permission of its own on this path: it hands the
 * call to `turn.tools.call()`, which is the same guard, the same approval
 * machinery, the same audit row and the same transcript mirror the in-process
 * path uses. Parity is by construction, not by a second implementation.

/**
 * The turn-credential REGISTRY — composition's half of the door's second door.
 *
 * It lives HERE, beside the types it speaks, because both ends attach to it and
 * neither owns it: a harness runtime publishes each live turn, and
 * `createMcpDoor` reads. The umbrella (`createVendo`) and the standalone agent
 * runtime (`agent()`) each compose one, and neither may reach the other's
 * package — this block is the lowest one both may depend on.
 *
 * **The credential in five sentences.** The host process mints an opaque token
 * for one conversation, and only ever from INSIDE a live turn of that
 * conversation, which is what binds it to a subject nobody had to name. The
 * token states nothing — no subject, no scope, no venue — so there is nothing in
 * it to forge; it is a pointer at "the turn currently in flight on thread T".
 * Its authority window is that turn: between turns it resolves to nothing, and a
 * call arriving then is a 401, because a call with no turn behind it has no
 * accountability context to be judged in. It dies on `revoke()` (the machine
 * holding it was destroyed), when it has gone unused for the idle budget, and
 * permanently if its thread is ever seen carrying a different principal —
 * whichever comes first. Everything it can reach is what that
 * turn could already reach — `turn.tools`, which is the guard-bound registry
 * with the turn's own ctx.
