 *
 * 1. `tools/list` is parsed with the SDK's `ToolSchema`, whose `outputSchema` is
 *    `{ type: "object", properties?: Record<string, object>, required?: string[] }`.
 *    A top-level `{"type":"array"}` (ordinary in an OpenAPI spec) or a boolean

 *    parse and takes the WHOLE listing down, every other tool with it. So the
 *    shape is checked here, and a schema that cannot be stated is omitted.
 * 2. `cacheToolMetadata` (run on every successful `listTools()`) COMPILES every
 *    advertised schema with Ajv, and a compile throw likewise kills the entire
 *    listing. A shape check cannot see that: a dangling `$ref` (extraction leaves
 *    one for recursive response models — `actions/src/sync/openapi.ts`),
 *    `{"type":"bogus"}` and Swagger 2.0's boolean `exclusiveMinimum` are all
 *    well-shaped and all throw, so the door asks the client's own validator.
 * 3. `tools/call` THROWS on any non-`isError` result whose `structuredContent` is
 *    missing or fails the advertised schema — and the door cannot promise the
 *    host's declaration describes every result it must return (`toolOutputCap`'s
 *    truncation envelope, the `vendo_value` wrapper). So `additionalProperties` is
 *    forced open, {@link UNKEEPABLE_KEYWORDS} is dropped, and so is any declared
 *    property in the reserved `vendo_` namespace. Field names and types survive —
 *    the whole of D5's value to the model; what dies is the schema's power to
 *    REJECT a result the door has no choice about.
 *
 * The descriptor still carries the original for the in-process surfaces, which
 * have no wire constraint.
