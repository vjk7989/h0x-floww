/**
 * Route-scan input-schema inference (PR 2, 04 §1): a collector seam asked
 * once per (route, method) at route-scan's single emission point. Collector
 * order (spec-locked): zod-in-handler first (Task 2, reuses the
 * oracle-hardened `zodFromExpression` from `static-ts.ts`), then the
 * TypeScript-checker collector (Task 3, one lazily built `ts.Program` per
 * scan), with the query collector (Task 4) merging additively into whichever
 * of those two results comes back — the query collector runs unconditionally
 * for every (route, method), regardless of which (if any) body collector
 * answered. Every collector fails closed: no recognizable evidence means
 * `null`, and route-scan emits exactly what it emits today (path params
 * only, blank body/query).
 *
 * Review carry-over on the query collector (Task 4): this module reports
 * query evidence whenever it finds it, on ANY method — it does NOT know or
 * care whether the tool that evidence would attach to is query-bound or
 * body-bound. That gate lives one layer up, in route-scan.ts's
 * `mergeRouteInput`, because only route-scan.ts knows a tool's `argsIn`. The
 * reason the gate has to exist at all: `runtime/registry.ts`'s route
 * execution (~560-564) sends every non-path argument as `searchParams` for a
 * query-bound tool (`argsIn: "query"`, GET/DELETE) but as a single JSON body
 * for a body-bound tool (`argsIn: "body"`, POST/PUT/PATCH) — never split
 * across both. A query-derived property advertised on a body-bound tool
 * would be delivered in the JSON body and never reach `searchParams`, so the
 * handler would never see it: a lie to the calling agent. `mergeRouteInput`
 * therefore keeps query properties for query-bound tools and drops them
 * (silently — this is a scope decision, not a recognition failure, so it
 * carries no `note`) for body-bound ones.
