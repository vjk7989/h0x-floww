/**
 * THE LAW (§12), restated for the checking floor.
 *
 * The runtime already refuses to project an irreversible tool onto an unattended
 * run. This is the same law applied one step earlier — to what an app is
 * PLANNING to do at build time — so "email everyone on Friday" is caught while it
 * is still a plan and answered in plain language, instead of the person finding
 * out when a run fails.
 *
 * A judgment rule rather than a fact check: only a reader can tell that a
 * scheduled step moves money or messages a person, so it joins the reviewer's
 * rubric as its own line.
