/**
 * Every case in the StoreOps kit is a claim that some specific mistake would be
 * caught. A case that has only ever been run against implementations that
 * happen to be correct proves nothing about that claim — it may assert the
 * wrong thing, or nothing at all, and the day a second implementation arrives
 * the suite's silence is indistinguishable from its approval.
 *
 * So each case added by the conformance-hardening lane is run here against a
 * memory reference with exactly ONE rule broken, and asserted to go red for the
 * reason it was written for. The message is asserted too: a case that fails for
 * an unrelated reason is not the same as a case that caught its own bug.
 *
 * The CONCURRENCY flaws deserve a note. `memoryStoreOps` does its work without
 * a single `await` inside any verb, so two calls fired at one instant run to
 * completion one after the other and no race is observable — which is why the
 * raced cases pass against it, and against PGlite's single connection, without
 * proving anything there. The flaws below put the `await` back exactly where a
 * real implementation has one: between the read and the write that depends on
 * it. That window is the whole bug, on every engine that has more than one
 * connection, and these are the only runs in the repo that open it on purpose.
