    `field` must be one the collection registry declares indexed
    (`assertIndexedField`) — `vendo_runs.started_at` is the only one today.

    `after` is EXCLUSIVE and takes either of two forms. A caller's FIRST bound is
    a plain field VALUE ("everything since 9am"), which means strictly after that
    instant. Every bound after it is the previous page's echo
    ({@link EngineListPage}), an opaque token naming the exact row that page
    ended on: send it back VERBATIM, never parsed, never compared, never a
    timestamp to do arithmetic on. The stored value can carry more precision than

/** `engine.list`'s page.

    `watermark` is present EXACTLY when a watermark bound was applied, and its
    value is the bound to send next time — an opaque RESUME TOKEN naming the last
    row of this page, or the requested `after` unchanged when the page was empty.
    A walk driven by this echo visits every row EXACTLY ONCE and terminates,
    INCLUDING rows that share the indexed field's value.

    A token rather than that value, because the value alone cannot say WHERE
    INSIDE a group of rows sharing it a page stopped, and those groups are
    routine: `vendo_runs.started_at` is caller-supplied and callers write
    `new Date().toISOString()`, so a burst of runs shares one millisecond. Asking
    for "strictly after that instant" then drops whatever was left of the group,
    silently and permanently — uncounted usage for the meter this walk exists
    for. Each implementation spells its token its own way; hand it back as
    {@link Watermark}.`after` unchanged and never parse or compare one.

    That is deliberately doing two jobs at once, and the second one is why it
    exists. Wire request bodies pass unknown keys through, so a mount older than
    the bound parses the query, ignores it, and answers with an ordinary
    newest-first page: a silently WRONG answer, not a refusal. Every other new
    op is a new PATH, and an old mount answers those with an enveloped 501 that
    says exactly what is missing — a field on an existing op has no such
    protection, and this echo is it. A caller that sent a watermark and got no
    echo back must treat the page as unserved, not as data.

    (The `/status` op count would not do here. It is a whole-mount version level
    and it can only be trusted to say a mount is BEHIND, never that it is
    complete; and it is checked before sending, which a read never needs to do —
    reads are safely retryable, which is why the batch APPEND, a mutation, is
    the one op that must feature-detect up front instead.) */

  /** The audit drawer's own reads — both of them reads, because reading is all
      anyone does to it: `vendo_audit` is append-only, and rows leave it only
      through the erase cascade and the retention window.

      Two verbs and not one because a count is not a page. A reviewer's feed
      wants the newest rows and pages through them; a decision tally wants a
      whole window collapsed to numbers, and getting it out of `list` means
      downloading every row in the window to count it client-side. Same drawer,

      Three verbs and not two for `audit`'s reason plus one: a policy's question
      is a single number for one user, an operator's is every user's number over
      a window, and neither is the other's answer sliced. The write is here and
      not on `engine` because a meter row is only ever counted, never listed.

      OPTIONAL (`retention`'s rule): a store with nowhere to meter says so by
      omitting the family. A configured `LimitsCallback` then has no
      counts to decide on, so it is refused at composition — never enforced

      window that turns out to be wrong is recoverable right up until the purge.

      The engine OWNS the quarantine: where the lifted rows go, what that store
      is called and how it is shaped are the engine's business, and no caller
      ever names it. `purge` is the only way back out.

      OPTIONAL (`RecordStore.atomic`'s rule): an engine with nowhere to quarantine
