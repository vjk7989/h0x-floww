 * What became of a guarded call the guard PARKED, once its approval is decided.

 * Two lanes park calls and both resume them from the SAME
 * `guard.onApprovalDecision` seam: the venue-neutral BYO one
 * (`packages/vendo/src/byo-approvals.ts`) and the apps runtime's in-app actions
 * (`packages/apps/src/server/persistence/parked-action.ts`). By the time either
 * resumes, the surface that asked is long gone from the call stack — a foreign
 * agent loop, or a generated screen sitting on "Sending…" — so the answer is
 * PERSISTED here, keyed by the approval, and `GET /approvals/:id` serves it back.
 *
 * The shape and the collection live in core because both writers and the single
 * reader must agree on them and none of them may import each other (layering).
