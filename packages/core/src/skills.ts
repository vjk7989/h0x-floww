 * model at a tool that does not exist.
 *
 * `/host/**` is a PER-TURN PROJECTION, not stored rows: a composed skill is a
 * plain code value, so the host's own deploy IS its update path and there is
 * nothing to migrate, invalidate, or erase. {@link hostSkillFiles} turns the
 * merged skills into the path→content map the workspace is opened with; the
 * mount is read-only through the façade, and this module never writes.
 *
 * Whatever ends up on the mount is the one source of truth for what exists,
 * which is why a host's own hand-authored SKILL.md lists beside a composed one
 * without registering anywhere.
