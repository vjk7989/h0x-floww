/**
 * Build contract §9.2–§9.4 — the executable definition of `can()`.
 *
 * There are two implementations of this seam: `appAccess(store)` in
 * @vendoai/store, and the stand-in @vendoai/apps' own tests run against a
 * memory store (the runtime cannot import the store — `apps → core` is the only
 * edge layering allows it). Two implementations of one rule is exactly how a
 * permission check rots: mutate the real `can()` to `return true` and the
 * stand-in's suite stays green.
 *
 * So the RULE lives here, once, and both implementations mount it. A case that
 * fails is a divergence, whichever side moved.
