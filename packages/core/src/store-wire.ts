    none: `/status` is already the discovery handshake, and the count is its
    only signal. Compared with `>=`, and FROZEN at the count this op shipped
    with — `===` would refuse the op the day a 37th is added, pinning every
    client on the slow path forever with nothing to see; and
    `Object.keys(STORE_WIRE_PATHS).length` would do the same from the client's
    side.

    ⚠ ADDING OP 37? READ THIS. The count is a PROXY for capability, and it
    holds only while ops are ONLY EVER ADDED. Remove one while adding another
    and the count still reaches 36 on a mount that no longer serves this op —
    the client then believes it is supported, sends it, and takes the loud 501
    this whole mechanism exists to avoid. That is not hypothetical: console
    #468 ("restore the `records.*` store wire deleted by #456") is a production
    incident from exactly that shape. Deleting a wire op means retiring this
    constant, not renumbering it.

    Detect once, cache, and route to the older getThread + putMessage path when
    the mount is behind — never send it blind and read the 501 as a fallback
    signal (#1251: a failed mutation is not a capability answer).

    ⚠ AND A SECOND CONSTANT OF THIS KIND MUST CLEAR THE BAR BELOW — only
    STORE_WIRE_TURN_OPS ever has. Ops 37-48 (audit, secrets, footprint,
    retention, the audit tally, usage) added no twin, and most ops should not.
    A pre-send check earns its keep only when sending blind is
    unsafe, and that is true of exactly one shape: a MUTATION with a cheaper
    fallback, where a 501 leaves the caller unable to tell "never ran" from
    "ran and failed". Every one of 37-45 is a new PATH, so an older mount
    refuses it with the enveloped 501 this protocol already answers unknown ops
    with — loud, specific, and impossible to mistake for data. The one
    genuinely invisible addition, the watermark bound on `engine.list`, is a
    FIELD on an existing op that `.passthrough()` would let an old mount ignore
    in silence; it is detected by the echo on its own answer
