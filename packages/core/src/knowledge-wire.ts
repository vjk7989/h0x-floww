    selector of any kind (R5 invariant 1: tenancy derives server-side).
    Verbs: the four adapter operations are POST-JSON RPC; `status` is GET and
    doubles as the discovery handshake (format + posture). Requests to an
    endpoint the declared posture does not cover (POST /upsert or /remove on
    `write: false`, POST /fetch on `fetch: false`) are answered with the
    `not-implemented` envelope, 501 — never a bare 404, never `blocked`.
    Servers validate request bodies against the schemas in this module and
    answer schema-invalid bodies with the `validation` envelope, 400. The
    principal deliberately never crosses the wire — visibility is the only
    context-derived behavior, and it rides `includeInternal`. */

    `includeInternal` is legitimate on the wire ONLY because every mounting
    surface is a key-authed, host-trusted hop (R5, KB-COV-7): the OSS
