 *     `automations/src/sponsorship-gate.ts`), so a venue-based predicate would
 *     let every schedule out from under the law.
 *   - `{ venue: "automation", presence: "present" }` is a CEREMONY, not a run:
 *     the enable/capture flow and the "allow this while you're away" approval
 *     card both run with a human right there clicking, and they must SEE the

 *     filtered those tools out of the ceremony's own descriptor lookup, so
 *     enabling an automation reported a registered host tool as "unknown tool
 *     in automation" — the law breaking its own prescribed
 *     prepare-then-human-sends path.
 *
 *  `presence` is a required field (`"present" | "away"`), so this fails closed:
 *  there is no absent-value case that reads as attended. Every real firing
 *  passes `presence: "away"` (automations engine, schedules, agent runner,

 *  - never reaches `destructive`, which is checked first and has no exemption at
