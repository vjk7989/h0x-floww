/**
 * The apps runtime's ANSWER shapes that the client must speak too.
 *
 * Membership rule, and the only one: a shape belongs here when `@vendoai/apps`
 * produces it and `@vendoai/ui` consumes it off the wire. `ui → apps` is not an
 * edge the dependency guard allows, so before this the client hand-declared its
 * own copy "verbatim from the frozen contract text" — which is a promise, not a
 * mechanism, and the copies drifted. Same split, same reason, as
 * {@link ./app-access.js}: the shape lives in core, the implementation stays in
 * the block that owns the behavior.
 *
 * Only the shapes BOTH sides speak move here. An apps-internal shape (the
 * placement STORAGE row, say) stays in apps.
