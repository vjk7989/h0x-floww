/**
 * The harness contract.
 *
 * Types only, so every block may speak them: `defineHarness` and the runtime
 * that builds a `Turn` live in `@vendoai/harnesses` (build contract §2). The
 * dividing line these shapes draw: we own state, tools, checks, guard, and
 * skills; the harness owns thinking — and orchestration is thinking. A harness
 * receives a `Turn` and yields a closed event vocabulary; it never persists,
 * never touches the wire, and never decides whether a call is allowed.
 *
 * §1.5's `HarnessEvent` list is CLOSED — the one post-v1 addition is `notice`
 * (2026-08-10 ruling: code never speaks in the assistant's voice), routed to
 * the transcript as a persisted system part; hosts that don't recognize the
 * part ignore it (§15 forward-compat).
