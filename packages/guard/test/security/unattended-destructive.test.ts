  // fires genuine unattended work as `{ venue: "automation", presence: "away" }`
  // — including a machine app's own `vendo.json` schedules, which
  // `packages/apps/src/server/automation/plan.ts` folds into document triggers that
  // same engine fires — so a venue-keyed predicate would put every scheduled
  // firing outside the law.
