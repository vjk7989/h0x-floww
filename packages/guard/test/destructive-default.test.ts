/**
 * The blank state, for the grade that cannot be taken back.
 *
 * `ungraded` already asked here (D3) and every preset asks or blocks on
 * `destructive` — `cautious` is the intended posture in writing. The guard's own
 * no-match default did not: with no policy configured at all it RAN a declared
 * `destructive` tool without asking, so the one install where nothing else
 * speaks — a hand-wired server — was the one install that deleted things
 * silently. Same posture as `ungraded` for the same reason: not-knowing and
 * not-undoable both need a person.
