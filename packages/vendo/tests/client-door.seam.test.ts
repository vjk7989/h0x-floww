/**
 * The seam between the shipped client and the shipped door.
 *
 * `@vendoai/ui`'s `createVendoClient` is one half of a contract whose other half
 * is this package's wire route table. A ui test cannot reach the door — ui is
 * layered to `@vendoai/core` alone — so ui proved its half against a fixture
 * wire that lives in ui too: the producer and the consumer each holding their own
 * copy of the route table, unable to disagree. `test/client.test.ts` asserted
 * `(method, path, body)` triples against that fixture's own request log, which
 * says what the client SENT and nothing about whether anything serves it.
 *
 * Here nothing is stubbed on either side. Every call is the real client method;
 * every answer is the real `vendo.handler` over a real PGlite store, a real
 * agent and a real apps runtime. `fetch` is the only double, and it is a wire,
 * not a fake: it hands the client's own Request to the door and returns the
 * door's own Response.
