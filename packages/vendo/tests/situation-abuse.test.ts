/**
 * Risk check (spec 2026-08-05 §2) — the situation channel is the one field on
 * POST /threads that carries raw client JSON straight onto the RunContext, and
 * it needs no session at all. `cappedSituation` (wire/threads.ts) is the whole
 * sanitizer between the two, and its own comment sets the contract: "anything
 * that is not an object, and anything past the budget, is dropped rather than
 * refused".
 *
 * These drive a REAL POST /threads through the REAL wire and read the result
 * back where it lands — the ctx a host tool is handed, and the system prompt the
 * model was actually given. No stub on either side.
