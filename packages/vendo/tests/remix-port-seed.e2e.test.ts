/**
 * THE ✦ FORK STARTS FROM THE PORT — and the port has to reach BOTH stores.
 *
 * A remix mints an app and then runs the person's instruction through the
 * ordinary edit door. For that edit to be an edit OF THE COMPONENT rather than a
 * fresh generation wearing its name, the splitter's ported source has to be
 * sitting in two independent places by the time the loop starts thinking:
 *
 *   1. `AppDocument.source["app.tsx"]` — what `open()` re-runs and renders.
 *   2. the workspace row at `/user/apps/<appId>/app.tsx` — what `edit_app` reads.
 *
 * They are NOT synced with each other. Seed only the workspace and the app cannot
 * be opened; seed only the document and `edit_app` answers "There is no file to
 * edit yet" and the model rewrites the component from nothing — green suite, dead
 * feature. So this test refuses to stub either side: a real PGlite store, a real
 * `createVendo`, the real checks floor, the real screen agent, the real workspace
 * façade. Only the MODEL is scripted, because what is measured is the doors.
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING ASSERTION is the `edit_app` call: its `find` string is lifted
 * VERBATIM from the ported source and appears nowhere else. It can only match if
 * the real port crossed the real seam into the real workspace. A regenerated
 * screen — the behaviour this replaces — fails it by construction.
 *
 * The one that must be able to fail: drop the checkout from `screenAssembler`
 * (packages/vendo/src/screen-agent.ts) and case 2 goes red with the hand's own
 * "There is no file to edit yet".
