/**
 * THE OUTSIDE-AGENT PIN — what a real external MCP client sees, and what the
 * door-ctx lane promised would not move.
 *
 * The door-ctx lane teaches the door to carry a live turn's accountability
 * context (venue, presence, the turn's own approval card, THE LAW's §12
 * withholding, the transcript mirror). Every one of those is ADDITIVE, for a
 * caller that legitimately has a turn. A client that came in the only way an
 * outside agent can — `/register` → `/authorize` → `/token`, PKCE, no turn —
 * must keep TODAY'S behavior exactly.
 *
 * So this file was written and run GREEN against the unmodified door FIRST, and
 * every assertion below is a measurement of that run, not a wish. If closing a
 * divergence for turn-bearing callers moves anything an outside agent can see,
 * it fails here.
 *
 * Read with `mcp-door-parity.e2e.test.ts` (the turn-bearing half) — both drive
 * the same composed host and the same minimal MCP client from
 * `mcp-door.test-util.ts`.
