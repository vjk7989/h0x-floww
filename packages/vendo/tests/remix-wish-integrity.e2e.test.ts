/**
 * THE WISH LIST IS THE REMIX — so what goes on it, and what a follow-up edit is
 * allowed to do to the screen, are both data-integrity properties.
 *
 * A remix's `seed.wishes` replays in order on every Update, so anything that
 * lands on it is an edit the person keeps forever. Two ways that went wrong in
 * one live session (Maple, 2026-08-18): one follow-up ask was refused three
 * times and left FOUR entries on the list, and the attempt that finally landed
 * had abandoned the ported source and rewritten the app out of the host's
 * catalog, losing the first wish's edit.
 *
 * Both are seams between the front door, the memory door and the assembly loop,
 * so neither side is stubbed: a real PGlite store, a real `createVendo`, the
 * real `vendo_make` tool called the way a calling agent calls it, the real
 * checks floor, the real screen agent and the real workspace façade. Only the
 * MODEL is scripted — what is measured is the doors.
 *
 * The second test scripts a SOURCE-SENSITIVE model on purpose: it edits the
 * screen when the loop puts one in front of it and writes a catalog card when it
 * does not, which is exactly what the live model did. That makes the assertion
 * about the loop's own prompt, not about a mood — the run is deterministic
 * either way, and the two outcomes are distinguishable in the stored screen.
 *
 * The ones that must be able to fail:
 *  1. drop the `landed` gate in `remember` (`apps/server/doors/write-surface.ts`)
 *     and "a follow-up that does not land" goes red with a second wish.
 *  2. restore the `!(await base.exists(checkout))` guard around `storedScreen`
 *     in `screenAssembler` (`vendo/src/screen-agent.ts`) and "the follow-up edits
 *     the port" goes red: the screen loses the first wish and holds the catalog
 *     card instead.
