/**
 * The rebuildability proof — contract §2.2/§2.3, Track B's done bar.
 *
 * "The code lives in your database like everything else." `doc.source` is the
 * app's only home, and the way to know it really is one is to rebuild the app
 * from a store that has never held its files.
 *
 * So this is a seam test with no stub on either side (repo CLAUDE.md's testing
 * law). Every piece is the shipped one:
 *
 *   - the real PGlite store, and the real `workspaceStore(store, { files })` façade
 *   - the real `wrapWorkspaceForRender` commit interception, wired the way
 *     `server.ts` wires it: `commitSource: (input) => apps.commitSource(input, ctx)`
 *   - the real `createApps` runtime behind that verb, so ownership, the
 *     compare-and-swap update and the blob spill are the production ones
