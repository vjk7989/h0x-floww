/**
 * THE OUTSIDE-LOCKOUT PIN — an INTERNAL-only door, and the proof that nothing
 * an outsider could use is there.
 *
 * `harness: claudeCode()` reaches the host's tools over the host's own MCP door
 * (10-mcp §3b), so a composition that names such a harness gets a door whether
 * or not it asked for one. `mcp: true` must keep its single meaning — "my users
 * may connect third-party agents to my product" — so the door composition
 * grows a second, narrower shape: the turn-credential half ALONE.
 *
 * This file is `mcp-door-outside-agent.e2e.test.ts` INVERTED. That file measures
 * what a real external MCP client sees at a full door; this one measures that
 * the same client finds nothing at all — no discovery, no authorization server,
 * no registration, no consent, no session, no listing, and a 401 that names no
 * way in. The first test is the control: the door IS mounted and a live turn
 * goes straight through it, so every absence below is a lockout and not an
 * unmounted route.
 *
 * Written and run RED first against a FULL door (the composition below with
 * `mcp: true`), where every lockout assertion fails.

/**
 * WHERE the harness dials, which is the other half of "zero extra config".
 *
 * A door that exists and cannot be reached is the same as no door, so the goal
 * is only met if a machine-less `claudeCode()` finds its own host with nothing
 * set. It does that by learning the origin the wire was reached at — and that
 * origin is derived from the HOST HEADER, which is attacker-controllable.
 *
 * The first shipping of this rule was poisonable: in development with no
 * `VENDO_BASE_URL`, ONE request carrying `Host: attacker.evil` fixed the origin
 * process-wide, after which the harness sent `Authorization: Bearer vtk_…` and
 * every tool call to the attacker. It also reached `mcp: true` compositions,
 * because the rule is about the HARNESS's door target, not about which door
 * shape was mounted.
 *
 * So the learned origin is now LOOPBACK-ONLY, and the first qualifying request
 * fixes it: a non-loopback Host is never a candidate, and a later loopback Host
 * cannot replace an earlier one. `localhost` is where a machine-less thinker's
 * subprocess actually lives, so nothing about zero-config dev is lost.
