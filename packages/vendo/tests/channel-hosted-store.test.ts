/**
 * The channel's rows against the HOSTED door — the seam that actually ships.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: every other channel test composes a local store, and a
 * local store has no engine allowlist in front of it. The hosted door does
 * (`engine-collections.ts`), and a Cloud host leaves the store slot unset, so
 * hosted is the posture the feature runs in. The channel shipped with its three
 * collections missing from that list: the suite was green, and the first write on
 * the live deployment answered
 *   403 collection "vendo_channel_links" is not an engine collection
 * which made link, status, unlink and every inbound text dead on arrival.
 *
 * So these cases exercise the repositories through `hostedStore`, whose fake
 * console serves the same gate the live door serves — deliberately, per the note
 * at `hosted-store.test-util.ts`: a fake that answers a collection the real door
 * refuses lets a wrong call pass every test and fail in production. Add a
 * collection to this feature and it must appear both in `channel-links.ts` and in
 * `ENGINE_COLLECTIONS`, or this file goes red.
