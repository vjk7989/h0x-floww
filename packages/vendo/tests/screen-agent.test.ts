/**
 * The screen agent (blueprint §4.2).
 *
 * These are SEAM tests, not loop tests: every case writes through the real
 * `WorkspaceFs` staging + `commit()` path and reads back through the real render
 * seam (`wrapWorkspaceForRender` → `viewForWrite` → the floor's real component
 * gauntlet), with no stub on either side. A harness that mocked the seam would
 * prove only that this file agrees with itself.
 *
 * THE ARTIFACT IS `app.tsx` (`SCREEN_FILE`) — one React component, which the seam
 * paints only by way of `AppFloor.component`. That door is the REAL
 * `createAppFloor` here: esbuild compiles the file, the scan reads it, tsc
 * type-checks it against these very descriptors, and QuickJS renders it once on
 * what the guard-bound registry really answered. Leaving that slot empty is not a
 * lighter test — the seam refuses to paint `app.tsx` at all without it, so every
 * save would silently vanish and the loop would be measured against nothing.
 *
 * What is deliberately a double: the MODEL (scripted provider chunks, so the loop
 * is what is measured) and the one half that needs a STORE — the row a passing
 * screen earns (`AppsRuntime.authoredScreen`, the floor's `delivered`). The real
 * ones — row, queries, receipt — are walked end to end through a composed
 * deployment in `packages/vendo/tests/screen-route.e2e.test.ts`.
