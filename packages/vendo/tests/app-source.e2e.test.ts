/**
 * The app's source layout and the commit seam — contract §3.2.
 *
 * The point of the contract is that the ROW is the truth and a workspace is a
 * working copy of it. So this test refuses to mock either side: an app row lands
 * in a real store, a real `workspaceStore(...).open()` filesystem is written and
 * committed through, and `commitApp` diffs it into `doc.source` — the real write
 * path end to end, with the real store answering. If the producer and the store
 * disagree about the layout, the bytes land wrong or not at all, which is exactly
 * what a stubbed counterparty could never tell us.
