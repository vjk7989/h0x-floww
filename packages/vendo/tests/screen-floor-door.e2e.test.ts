/**
 * THE FLOOR'S DOOR, ON THE SAVE THAT DID NOT REACH THE SCREEN.
 *
 * Live 2026-08-06 (main @ ce98c546, demo-bank, "a dashboard for my upcoming bills
 * and subscriptions"), the dev server said this and nothing else:
 *
 *   [vendo] render seam: source did not reach the store
 *     { error: 'app_b96… has no row to hold its source' }
 *   [vendo] validate failed: VendoError: app not found: app_b96…
 *
 * The first of those two is gone: no row YET is not a failure, so `commitSource`
 * skips quietly and says so at info level (write-surface.ts). The second is the
 * one the loop had to hear, and it now arrives in the loop's own prompt.
 *
 * One save landed bytes the seam would not paint. No paint means no row — for a
 * component screen the gauntlet's own `ok` is what earns it (`AppFloorOptions.
 * delivered`) — and `validate({appId})` is row-scoped (`requireOwned`), so the one
 * door the assembly loop was then told to use as its floor answered `not-found` on
 * exactly the document that needed judging. The loop learned nothing, saved again,
 * and the screen the person kept was never judged by anything it could hear from.
 * The loop has no `validate` verb at all now, which makes the hand's own gate the
 * only thing that can speak.
 *
 * So this walks a REAL composed deployment — real store, real guard, real apps
 * pack, real render seam, the real checks floor, the real `validate` verb — and
 * asserts what the LOOP was told about the bytes it saved. Only the model is
 * scripted, because what is measured is the doors, not a provider's mood.
 *
 * The one that must be able to fail: drop the gate from `save_app`
 * (`packages/vendo/src/screen-agent.ts`) and the first case goes red — the hand
 * answers "That save landed." over a document that never reached the screen, which
 * is the bypass.
