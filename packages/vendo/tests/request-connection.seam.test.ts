/**
 * The `request_connection` seam.
 *
 * The agent DECIDES to ask (the tool, in @vendoai/agent) and the chrome RENDERS
 * the ask (the connect card, in @vendoai/ui). Those are two packages that never
 * import each other, and the only thing joining them is the shape of one
 * `connect-required` outcome as it crosses the wire. A test that hand-writes
 * that outcome on the render side proves nothing — it is the producer and the
 * consumer each holding their own copy, exactly how the host-component previews
 * shipped green and dead.
 *
 * So nothing here is stubbed on either side. A real harness turn calls the real
 * tool through the real `createVendo` composition (real store, real connector,
 * real registry, real connect port over the real connections catalog); the door
 * persists and serves the turn; the shipped `VendoThread` reads that thread back
 * over the real client and paints the real `ConnectCard`. The only double is the
 * network itself — `fetch` is routed straight into the door's handler.
