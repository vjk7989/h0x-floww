/**
 * THE ASK-TYPE MATRIX — the proof `experimentalScreenAgent`'s own comment asked
 * for before the flag could die ("OFF until the six-type proof matrix is
 * walked, because it changes which engine answers every screen ask").
 *
 * Five ask types, all through `vendo_make`, on a REAL composed deployment: real
 * store, real guard, real apps pack, real render seam, real checks floor, real
 * front door, real MCP door. Nothing on either side of any seam is stubbed
 * except the two things a test genuinely cannot have — the MODEL (scripted, so
 * ROUTING and not a provider's mood is what this measures) and the sandbox
 * PROVIDER, which is a fake box that behaves like a box: two listeners (the
 * app's $PORT and the harness control port), an in-box agent that actually
 * materializes files on the box's disk, a `vendo.json`, and snapshot/resume.
 *
 *  1. new simple screen        → assembled, row real, view painted
 *  2. edit of an existing one  → lands in place, repaints on the SAME stream id
 *  3. bigger than a screen     → a failed receipt, and no box, because there is no door out
 *  4. assembler unavailable    → a failed receipt that says so, and nothing else runs
 *  5. the MCP door             → an outside agent gets words, and a screen lands
 *
 * There is ONE engine behind all five, and no second one behind it. The screen
 * agent carries no `escalate` hand, so case 3 is what an ask assembly cannot
 * serve now costs: an honest failure, with the machine sitting right there
 * unprovisioned. Case 2 is the same engine again — an edit is the screen agent
 * opening the app's own document and saving it back.
