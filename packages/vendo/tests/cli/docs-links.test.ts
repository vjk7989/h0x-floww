/**
 * Every docs.vendo.run URL the CLI can PRINT has to reach a page that exists.
 *
 * Five of them did not. The docs restructure moved `existing-agents/*` to
 * `existing-agent/*`, retired `/quickstart#the-client-mount`, and replaced the
 * one `agents/verify` playbook with a page per doctor code — and the CLI kept
 * printing the old spellings for months, because nothing in the repo connected a
 * string literal in `src/cli/` to a file in `docs-site/`. This is that
 * connection.
 *
 * Scope: `src/cli/`, which is what the CLI prints — the runtime's own links are
 * a different surface with a different lifecycle.
 *
 * DIRECT resolution only. A `docs.json` redirect is deliberately not accepted:
 * every one of the five stale URLs had one, so a redirect-following check greens
 * a CLI that has been printing retired paths for a year — the redirect table is a
 * compatibility shim for links already printed by SHIPPED binaries, not a licence
 * for the next release to print them too. Anchors are checked only as far as the
 * PAGE (a fragment never reaches the server, so it can select nothing).
