/**
 * D5 — `vendo_delegate` runs on the composed away runner, not on a second engine.
 *
 * The behaviour that proves the swap is PERSISTENCE: `createAgent`'s mini-loop
 * was a stateless `generateText` that left nothing behind, while a harness run
 * mints a thread and writes its transcript. So the check is the store, read back
 * through the real read path — a delegation now has a `thr_*` row with the
 * delegated task in it.
