/**
 * EVERY FINISHED SCREEN FACES THE REVIEWER, WITH THE EVIDENCE.
 *
 * Live 2026-08-06 (demo-bank, "make me a dashboard for my upcoming bills and
 * subscriptions"): the screen summed two overlapping query results into one
 * headline — $11,216 where the truth was ~$6,276. Every mechanical check passed,
 * because a double count is not a shape error: the binding was well typed, the
 * field existed, the tool was real. The AI reviewer is the only check that could
 * have caught it, and it never ran — it fires only when the writing model
 * volunteers to call `validate({appId})`, and this one did not.
 *
 * So this walks a REAL composed deployment — real store, real guard, real apps
 * pack, real render seam, the real checks floor, the real `validate` verb, real
 * host tools returning real overlapping rows — and asserts what happens to a
 * finished screen whose writer never asked to be checked. Only the model is
 * scripted, because what is measured is the doors, not a provider's mood.
 *
 * The ones that must be able to fail:
 * - drop the `judgeScreen` call from `assembleScreen`
 *   (`packages/vendo/src/screen-agent.ts`) and case 1 goes red — the reviewer
 *   is never called and the double count ships, which is the incident.
 * - stop passing `queryResults` to `reviewComponentScreenInput` (the validate door
 *   in `packages/apps/src/server/doors/build-surface.ts`) and case 1 goes red at
 *   the evidence assertion — the reviewer double cannot see the overlap it is
 *   asked to judge, so it reports nothing, exactly as the live reviewer would have.
