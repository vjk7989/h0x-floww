/**
 * The turn's TWO tool-call watchers, through the REAL composition.
 *
 * `agent_run`'s `toolCalls`/`tools` are counted by a hook composition puts on the
 * bridge (harness-turn.ts); the capability-miss detector's hook is added by the
 * harness runtime (harnesses/runtime.ts). They shared ONE `onCall` slot and the
 * runtime's assignment won, so a composed turn that really executed host tools
 * reported `{ toolCalls: 0, tools: [] }` — in every composed deployment, since
 * composition always configures capability miss.
 *
 * Only a real turn can show that. A unit test that calls `onCall` itself never
 * touches the assignment that discarded it, and a harness that mocks either
 * watcher lets the two agree forever. So: one composed turn, real host tools that
 * really run, both watchers read through their own production read path — the
 * usage sink for the count, and the reporter tool's `reported` latch for the miss
 * detector (it answers `false` only once the detector has already fired).
