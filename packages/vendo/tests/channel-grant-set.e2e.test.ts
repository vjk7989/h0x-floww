/**
 * AN OUTSTANDING GRANT SET, ASKED OVER TEXT, ALL THE WAY TO A FIRING THAT
 * DELIVERS.
 *
 * The gap this pins, live 2026-08-18 on production Maple: a user armed "check my
 * checking balance every 15 minutes and text me" entirely over iMessage, and
 * arming minted pending standing-grant captures. Those asks are approval rows the
 * engine writes during the authoring call, not stream parts, so they had exactly
 * one surface: the host app's web approvals feed. A text-only user could never
 * reach it, so every firing ran without the Text me grant and the agent could only
 * say "there are still some permissions pending approval". This one text is how
 * they get asked.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED under it (job-shaped arming consent, same day): a normal arming no
 * longer leaves anything pending. The powers are named on the authoring call's own
 * approval and one yes mints them, so there is nothing for this text to offer —
 * `channel-arming-consent.e2e.test.ts` pins that, including that no follow-up text
 * is sent. The set ask is now the LEFTOVER path, and this file exercises the
 * leftover that actually happens: an arming the host's policy ran WITHOUT asking
 * anybody, which is `vendo_make`'s read-graded arming and any host whose policy
 * lets authoring through. Nobody saw a powers line, so nothing may be minted off
 * it, and each power is captured as a pending ask exactly as before.
 *
 * Nothing is stubbed between the two halves: real `createVendo`, real guard, real
 * automations engine, one real PGlite store, the real `cloudTextChannel` client,
 * and an HTTP console standing in for the one half this repo does not own. The
 * grants are read back through the path that actually gates a firing — the away
 * run's own call to `vendo_text_me` reaching the console — because a grant row
 * that the guard would not honour proves nothing.
