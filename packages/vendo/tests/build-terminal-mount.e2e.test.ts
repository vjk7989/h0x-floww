/**
 * NOBODY MOUNTS A DRAFT THE BUILD IS ABOUT TO CORRECT.
 *
 * A screen saves as it goes, so its app ROW lands at the first save that paints —
 * and the mandatory reviewer pass and its one repair round run AFTER that
 * (`assembleScreen`, packages/vendo/src/screen-agent.ts). Every surface that
 * mounts from the row (`useApp` → VendoSlot's MountedApp and Remixable's fork,
 * and VendoAppEmbed's poll) stops looking the moment `open()` answers, so a
 * person could be shown the draft — a wrong NUMBER included — while the server
 * already held the corrected version, with nothing but a page reload to fix it.
 *
 * So this walks a REAL composed deployment — real store, real render seam, real
 * checks floor, real reviewer verb, real host tools — and reads the app back
 * through the REAL `open()` and the REAL wire route AT THE INSTANT the draft has
 * painted and the repair has not run. Only the model is scripted; both sides of
 * the seam are the shipped ones.
 *
 * The two that must be able to fail:
 * - drop the `buildInFlight(app.building)` gate from `openSurface`
 *   (packages/apps/src/server/persistence/open.ts) and BOTH mid-build reads go
 *   red — `open()` serves the double-counted draft and the wire hands it to the
 *   embed, which is the incident.
 * - stamp `building` only when the row is new (`previous === undefined` in
 *   `screenDocument`, packages/apps/src/server/doors/write-surface.ts) and the
 *   EDIT's read goes red on its own. That was the shipped gap: a ✦ remix and an
 *   edit both build onto a row that already exists, so a create-only gate left
 *   the number-changing repair the person actually watches unguarded.
