 * Docs-rot gate: the composition configuration table on handler-options.mdx must

 *
 * THE GATE THAT WASN'T. This file used to carry its own copy of the key list plus
 * an `AssertNever` that was supposed to fail compilation when the interface grew
 * a key. `packages/vendo/tsconfig.json` excludes `src/**\/*.test.ts` from
 * typecheck, so nothing ever compiled that assertion — the list sat ten keys
 * behind the interface and this test passed the whole time, because it was
 * comparing the docs against a stale list rather than against the type.
 *
 * The list now lives in `./config-keys.ts`, inside the typecheck include, where
 * both directions of the assertion are real (proven red: removing a key from the
 * list errors `Type '"automations"' does not satisfy the constraint 'never'`; adding an
 * invented one errors `Type '"notAKey"' is not assignable to keyof
 * CreateVendoConfig`). This file is the RUNTIME half.
