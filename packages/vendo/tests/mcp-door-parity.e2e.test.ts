/**
 * THE PARITY GATE — is the MCP door a drop-in replacement for the in-process
 * tool projection inside a `claudeCode()` turn?
 *
 * **cc-native measured NO (2026-08-02) and this file recorded the six ways.**
 * door-ctx closed all six, and the file is now FLIPPED: every assertion below
 * says IDENTICAL where it used to say "here is the gap". The gate is what let
 * the ask/park/answer bridge and the in-process projection be deleted, so if it
 * ever goes red again the box has quietly lost its accountability and the
 * deletion has to be reconsidered — not the assertion.
 *
 * It runs the same two tool asks — one `read` the `cautious` policy runs, one
 * `write` it parks for a human — through BOTH doors of ONE composed host (one
 * store, one guard, one policy, one registry, one subject) and compares:
 *
 *   - the AUDIT ROW: (outcome, decidedBy, presence, venue, subject)
 *   - the APPROVAL BEHAVIOR: does the guard's ask reach the USER the same way,
 *     and does a denial behave the same way?
 *   - the TRANSCRIPT MIRROR: did the user's screen and the stored thread see it?
 *
 * How the six closed, in one line each:
 *
 *   1. harness credential — the door has a second credential space (10-mcp
 *      §3b): an opaque pointer at the turn in flight, minted by the host process
 *      from inside that turn. `turn-credentials.test.ts` is what it REFUSES.
 *   2. presence — the turn's own, because the door projects `turn.ctx` verbatim.
 *   3. venue — likewise. A chat turn's door call audits `venue: "chat"`.
 *   4. approvals — the door calls `turn.tools.call()`, which is the in-process
 *      ask machinery: card on the turn's stream, wait, execute or deny.
 *   5. §12 withholding — `turn.tools.list()` is the ctx-projected, curated
 *      surface, so an unattended run is judged absent rather than told it is
 *      attended.
 *   6. mirror + commit — also `turn.tools.call()`'s, which mirrors and commits.
 *
 * The OUTSIDE-agent path is unchanged and pinned separately, in
 * `mcp-door-outside-agent.e2e.test.ts`.
