/**
 * THE MEMORY SEAM — the producer and the consumer, with a stub on neither side.
 *
 * An app's memory has two writers and two readers, in different packages, and the
 * only thing that can prove they agree is one run that goes all the way through:
 *
 *   producer  the screen agent's `save_app` hand (`@vendoai/harnesses`) and the
 *             front door's ask recording (`@vendoai/apps`)
 *   store     the real row, through the real `AppsRuntime.remember` door
 *   consumer  the edit brain's brief (`@vendoai/apps` generation), which is what
 *             the NEXT editor actually reads
 *
 * So this is a REAL composed deployment: real store, real guard, real apps pack,
 * real render seam, real checks floor, real front door. Only the MODEL is
 * scripted — this measures what the memory carries, not a provider's mood.
 *
 * The one that must be able to fail: delete the `remember` calls in
 * `agent-tools.ts` and "the three asks, verbatim and in order" goes red; delete
 * the memory block from `brainMessage` and "the edit brief opens with it" goes
 * red. Both re-checked by hand before every push (see the PR).
