/**
 * THE LAW's PROJECTION (design §12) must hold on the BYO door.
 *
 * `vendo.guardedTools` is the public registry the BYO packs execute through —
 * `toVendoAiSdkTools` and the mastra pack both hand it straight to a foreign
 * agent loop. It is assembled from `createByoApprovals().registry`, which
 * re-declared `descriptors()` with NO parameter and so silently swallowed the
 * projection context: `guard.bind` returns the FULL set when it is given no ctx,
 * so every destructive tool stayed visible to an unattended run.
 *
 * The execute-time refusal still held, so this was never an escape — but "the
 * model is never even offered it" is the property §12 buys, and it was absent on
 * this door. This is the identical bug the connect gate had
 * (`law-projection.e2e.test.ts`), one seam further out, which is why it is
 * asserted here through a REAL `createVendo` rather than a hand-built stack.
