/**
 * B2's regression gate — `createVendo({ sandbox, harness: claudeCode() })` must
 * SERVE the turn, not refuse it.
 *
 * The blocker: composition resolved a sandbox adapter, the boot gate approved it,
 * and then `createHarnessTurns` was never handed it — so the harness's machine
 * slot stayed empty and every turn came back "this assistant is missing its
 * workspace machine". Green boot, dead product.
 *
 * Why the existing tests all missed it, and why this file exists:
 *  - `claude-code.test.ts` calls `provideHarnessAdapters` BY HAND, which fills the
 *    slot composition was supposed to fill — the exact seam under test;
 *  - `harness-wire.test.ts` uses scripted harnesses, which need no machine;
 *  - `claude-code-composed.live.test.ts` uses `machine: "local"`, same.
 *
 * So this drives the REAL composition (`createVendo` → `vendo.handler` → the
 * store) with `claudeCode()` in the `harness:` slot and a sandbox adapter in the
 * `sandbox:` slot, and nothing hand-wired between them. Offline: the fake box
 * speaks the REAL box door over an in-process transport and only the SDK loop is
 * scripted.
