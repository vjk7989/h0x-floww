 * adapter rule says behaviour may never depend on which store is wired. It did:
 * the grammar guard lived in the local engine's routing layer
 * (`packages/store/src/routing.ts` `parseAppGrantData`), and the hosted store
 * posts straight to the console, so the SAME share was refused on Postgres and
 * accepted on Vendo Cloud's own default. The refusal is proven here on the shape
 * that had no coverage at all.
