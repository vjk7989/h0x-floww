/**
 * `toolBrief` — the brief's tool section, which is the loadout's COMPLEMENT: the
 * tools this loop may never CALL but a screen's `onClick` may name. Everything
 * equipped arrives with its own schema instead, so what this printer receives is
 * the WRITE side of the registry, which is why every fixture below is graded that
 * way (`screen-agent.ts`'s `wireable`).
