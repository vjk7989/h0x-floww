/**
 * PLACEMENT, through the doors a real caller actually uses.
 *
 * Every assertion here crosses a seam that a stub could hide:
 *  - the WRITE goes in over the real MCP door (register → authorize → token →
 *    JSON-RPC), through the real guard-bound registry and the real apps
 *    contribution;
 *  - the READ comes back out of the real store's `vendo_placements` rows, and
 *    what the slot SHOWS out of the real `GET /apps/placements` route a browser
 *    polls — the status is derived server-side, so a build that lands (or that
 *    never does) is measured where the person would see it. Nothing in this file
 *    knows how a placement is stored, and nothing in the apps runtime knows this
 *    file exists.
 *  - the PROJECTION is measured on real turns — one attended, one unattended —
 *    because the composed surface is declared STATICALLY
 *    (`toolsFromRegistry(appsAgentTools, agentToolDescriptors)` in server.ts),
 *    so the guard's projection is the only thing between an automation and a
 *    tool.
 *
 * This host has no sandbox, so `vendo_make` here is always served by the
 * ASSEMBLY engine. The escalated-builder half of `slot` is proved one layer
 * down, in `packages/apps/tests/agent-tools.test.ts`, where a fake box makes that
 * route reachable.
