/**
 * THE DEAD SEAM — the screen agent's way of asking for a build, and where it
 * lands.
 *
 * `RunRecord.escalated` was READ by the outcome gate and WRITTEN by nobody, so
 * `screen.assemble()` could never answer `escalate`, `vendo_make`'s escalate arm
 * was dead code, and no chat ask could reach the build lane at all. Live in
 * Maple (2026-08-24) an ask that genuinely needed a real build produced a
 * degraded screen and "this product's screen-building tool isn't that" — no
 * card, no build, no box.
 *
 * So nothing on either side of that seam is faked here: a REAL composed
 * deployment, the real front door, the real screen loop with its real loadout,
 * the real build door and the REAL guard, whose parked ask IS the standing card.
 * Two things are stand-ins, both of them the things a test cannot have: the
 * MODEL (scripted, so the loadout is what is measured rather than a provider's
 * mood) and the sandbox PROVIDER — a stub that refuses to hand out a machine,
 * because the one thing this whole flow must not do before the person's yes is
 * claim a box.
 *
 * The last test closes the seam on the READ side too: the shipped `VendoThread`
 * reads that same turn back over the real client and paints the real
 * `ApprovalCard`. The producer and the consumer disagreeing about one wire part
 * is exactly how this ask reached a person mis-graded, so neither side gets to
 * hold its own copy of it.
