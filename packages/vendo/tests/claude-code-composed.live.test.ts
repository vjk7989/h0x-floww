/**
 * `claudeCode()` through the REAL composition — wave 2 lane E's acceptance half
 * that a unit test cannot reach.
 *
 * `harness-wire.test.ts` proves the composed path with SCRIPTED harnesses on
 * purpose (a model would make it measure a provider). This file is the opposite
 * trade, and it is gated on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so CI never pays it: one real
 * `claudeCode()` turn through `createVendo` → `vendo.handler` → the store, so
 * three things stop being inference and become facts:
 *
 *   - the composed slot actually drives the Agent SDK (E1);
 *   - `audit ⊇ transcript` holds on a claudeCode run (E7 — `audit-superset.e2e.test.ts`
 *     is the bar, and a guarded call made from inside a box has to clear it);
 *   - `turn.state` is DURABLE across turns through the store, not a process-lifetime
 *     map, and a HARNESS SWAP mid-conversation continues the thread from our
 *     transcript rather than restarting it (§1.3).
 *
 * `machine: "local"` because the box leg is proven separately
 * (`packages/vendo/tests/claude-code-box.live.test.ts`, and
 * end-to-end over a public tunnel in
 * `docs/verification/door-ctx/live-door-proof.mjs`) and adds a provider account
 * to a test whose subject is composition.
 *
 * **door-ctx.** The harness's tools are the host's own MCP door now, so a
 * composed `claudeCode()` needs one open and an origin the SDK subprocess can
 * resolve. On the local leg that is a LOOPBACK listener — the subprocess runs on
 * this machine, so `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` is a real, reachable, and entirely
 * un-mocked origin. The tool call below therefore travels a genuine HTTP MCP
 * round trip into `vendo.handler`, exactly as the box's does over the internet.
 *
 * **door-internal.** Not one composition here passes `mcp`. That option means
 * "my users may connect third-party agents to my product" and these hosts never
 * said it; naming `claudeCode()` is the whole ask, and composition answers with
 * the internal half of the door. So this file now exercises the DEFAULT
 * `claudeCode()` path rather than a door the host had to open by hand.
