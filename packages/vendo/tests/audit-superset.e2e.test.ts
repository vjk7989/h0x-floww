/**
 * `audit ⊇ transcript` — architecture design §3's mirroring invariant, and
 * evaluation E7's last line ("the audit trail is a superset of the transcript for
 * every run").
 *
 * Why this file exists: the invariant was ASSERTED NOWHERE. `packages/harnesses`
 * has a comment naming it (runtime.ts, `reportRun`) and a dozen suites spot-check
 * one audit row apiece, but nothing compared the two planes — so any future
 * routing change that put an accountable event on the story layer and forgot the
 * audit row would ship green. Billing and reconciliation read the audit plane
 * ONLY; a hole there is money and a compliance answer, not a rendering bug.
 *
 * It drives ONE real composed turn through `vendo.handler` — real store, real
 * guard, real registry, real policy, a real interactive approval answered over the
 * wire — carrying every routing class §3 names: text, a guarded call, an approval,
 * an error, an in-box file op, and usage (in several events, the way a harness
 * that staffs helpers reports).
 *
 * WHAT "⊇" MEANS HERE, precisely. Read strictly as sets of events the relation is
 * false, and deliberately so: §3's own routing table sends `text` to "screen +
 * transcript" and gives it no audit row. The invariant's purpose clause is the
 * definition — "billing and reconciliation never depend on the story layer" — so
 * the superset is over ACCOUNTABLE events (anything with a consequence to
 * reconcile: a guarded call, an approval, a failure, hired staff, tokens spent),
 * and prose is the story layer itself rather than a member of the set. The
 * classification below is explicit per part type for exactly that reason, and an
 * UNKNOWN part type is a failure: a new persisted part is a new claim about which
 * plane it belongs to, and someone has to make it on purpose.

/**
 * GAP 3 — the failure card's dedupe and its skipped-run count.
 *
 * Design §3: "One card per missing grant per app, carrying a skipped-run count —
 * never one per failed firing."
 *
 * The composed e2e proves the CARD. What nothing proved is the arithmetic, and
 * the arithmetic is where the claim splits in two:
 *
 *  - Per-APP dedupe, keyed `(appId, tool)`, EXISTS — but at ENABLE time, in the
 *    automations engine's capture reuse (`pendingCaptures` → `pendingForApp` in
 *    `packages/automations/src/consent.ts`), and it is already covered by
 *    `engine.test.ts` ("re-running enable() reuses the pending ask — no duplicate
 *    ApprovalRequest per (appId, tool)"). That is the layer it lives at, so this
 *    file does not re-stage it.
 *  - Per-FIRING dedupe does NOT exist. `#parkApproval` mints `apr_<uuid>` per
 *    call with no lookup for an existing pending row for the same missing grant
 *    (`packages/guard/src/guard.ts`), so N failed firings leave N standing cards.
 *
 * The first test below PINS that real behaviour, so the contradiction is a fact in
 * the suite rather than a paragraph in a doc — and so the day someone implements
 * the dedupe, it goes red and points at the `.skip` beside it.
 *
 * An unattended turn is driven through `vendo.harness.stream` and not the wire on
 * purpose: `POST /threads` resolves `context("chat")` with `presence: "present"`
 * hard-coded (`packages/vendo/src/wire/context.ts`), so there is no header that
 * makes a wire turn away. The harness door takes the ctx, which is what an
 * automation firing supplies.
