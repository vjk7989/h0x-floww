/**
 * The per-turn refusal must not be a HALF-write.
 *
 * A store that offers neither a SQL handle nor a StoreOps surface (a host's own
 * adapter behind the public `VendoStore` surface) cannot keep the transcript and
 * the workspace, so `POST /threads` refuses the turn — that part is proven in
 * `harness-wire.test.ts`. What is NOT proven there is that the refusal leaves
 * the store as it found it.
 *
 * It does not. `createHarnessTurns().stream` resolves the thread and calls
 * `threads.persist(thread, [message])` — which goes through the adapter seam and
 * therefore SUCCEEDS on this store — before it ever asks for the transcript /
 * workspace doors (`sqlDoors()`), which is where the refusal is raised. So every
 * refused turn silently lands a `vendo_threads` row carrying the user's message
 * on a deployment that can never answer it, and a client that keeps retrying
 * keeps growing that thread.
 *
 * (harness-turn.ts: `await threads.persist(...)` runs before
 *  `const { transcript, workspaces, harnessState } = sqlDoors();`)
