/**
 * What the thinker is TOLD, across every reachable composition.
 *
 * This pins wave-1 live-proof P1 (`packages/vendo/proofs/p1-harness-path.mjs`),
 * which measured the three reachable ways a turn reaches a model and found the
 * documented opt-in — `harness: vendo()` — thinking with a ZERO-character system
 * prompt: no product brief, no catalog, no knowledge index, silently. The prompt
 * is assembled by composition because it needs the turn's `RunContext`, which a
 * `Turn` deliberately does not carry (§1), so a host could not work around it.
 *
 * The assertion is deliberately the strong one: non-empty AND identical. "Both
 * paths get something" would have passed while they drifted.
