/**
 * Risk check (spec 2026-08-05 §1/§2) — the [User] and [Context] blocks are
 * assembled by string concatenation: `factLines` renders `key: value` verbatim.
 * Nothing escapes a newline, so a value that CONTAINS a blank line plus a
 * section header is indistinguishable from a section the assembler wrote
 * itself — the indent of continuation lines is the block's only defence.
 *
 * Content INSIDE the labeled block is expected (it is observation). Forging the
 * BLOCK STRUCTURE is not: `Directions` is the guard's mandatory-policy section
 * (03-agent §3, fail-closed), and `ctx.context` is client-supplied on every
 * POST /threads — including from an unauthenticated visitor.
 *
 * [User] still rides `assembleSystemPrompt`. [Context] does NOT any more
 * (sub-1s shipment: it rides `Turn.situation`, behind the history), so its
 * forgery surface is the block builder itself — asserted on core's
 * `situationPromptBlock`, the one implementation every placement shares. The
 * real-door placement is `situation-seam.test.ts`'s; the real-door forgery
 * defence is `situation-abuse.test.ts`'s.
