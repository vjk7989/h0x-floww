/**
 * The LIVE leg: two real people, one org, a shared app — and a real e2b box.
 *
 * The offline sibling (`orgs-materialize.test.ts`) proves the two gates with a
 * scripted SDK loop, which means it proves OUR seams and not the model's hands.
 * This one removes the last stand-in: a real machine, the real box image (the
 * one `packages/apps/box/build-template.mjs` bakes, which carries the walk rule
 * this lane changed), a real Claude Agent SDK session, and a real model deciding
 * for itself which file to open. What is asserted is only what the user would
 * see: Kim asks for a change to the TEAM's app, and Dana sees it.
 *
 * Gated on `E2B_API_KEY` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `VENDO_BOX_TEMPLATE`, like every
 * `.live.test.ts`. No MCP door is composed on purpose: the subject here is the
 * workspace, and a box reaching a door needs a public origin this test has no
 * business minting. The harness warns once and runs with its own hands, which
 * is exactly the deployment shape a workspace-only host has.
 *
 * **The template matters here**, because this lane changes the box IMAGE (the
 * `/session/collect` walk in `packages/harnesses/box/turn-routes.mjs`): a run against
 * an image baked before the change collects `/user/` paths only and the team
 * file's edit never leaves the box. Proven on `vendo-box-orgs`
 * (`cnbt9dwz9ktvlplqhlq1`), a LANE-named template — never the shared `vendo-box`
 * id that production and every other consumer boot from, which is re-baked once
 * from the merged head. The id stays in the environment rather than in this
 * file so the same test runs against the shared image after the merge.
