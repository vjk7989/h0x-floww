/**
 * Docs-rot gate for the BYO-over-MCP story: the docs live in this repo, so this
 * is a plain test against the sources. It reads files and nothing else — no
 * package import, so it runs without a build.
 *
 * What it holds:
 *  1. the setup page exists, is in the nav, and every nav entry still resolves;
 *  2. the setup page opens the door, and both pages' links resolve;
 *  3. the door page no longer claims the door cannot create;
 *  4. the HTTP reference carries the three placement routes;
 *  5. the plugin skill teaches slot targeting and pin etiquette;
 *  6. the plugin's own surfaces point at the walkthrough.
