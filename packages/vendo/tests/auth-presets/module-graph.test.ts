/**
 * 09-vendo §2.1 / corpus-triage Task 9 — a bundler-style module-graph probe.
 *
 * Webpack (and every other bundler) resolves EVERY specifier in an ES
 * module's static `export ... from "x"` / `import ... from "x"` statements,
 * AND every literal-string `import("x")` call, to build its module graph —
 * regardless of whether the imported binding is ever used or the dynamic
 * import ever executes. Tree-shaking only trims the emitted bundle
 * afterwards; it does not skip resolution. So a host that imports anything
 * from "@vendoai/vendo/server" statically re-resolves every module reachable
 * from server.ts, even ones it never calls.
 *
 * Before this fix, `server.ts` re-exported all five auth presets from the
 * single barrel `auth-presets/index.ts`, which re-exported auth-js.ts and
 * clerk.ts alongside the others in the SAME file. Any host — even one using
 * no preset at all — therefore had `@auth/core/jwt` and `@clerk/backend`
 * reachable from its `@vendoai/vendo/server` import, and failed to build
 * without those optional peers installed ("Can't resolve '@auth/core/jwt'").
 *
 * This walker mirrors that resolution behavior (minus type-only imports,
 * which TypeScript erases before any bundler sees them) and asserts the
 * fixed server entry never reaches the optional peers, while confirming the
 * probe isn't vacuous: the per-preset modules still do, on their own.
