/**
 * THE equivalence test for the pack removal.
 *
 * `createVendo()` with nothing configured composes one tool registry and one
 * skills store. Deleting the pack noun moved WHERE those two sets are assembled;
 * it must not move WHAT is in them. The expected sets below are literals,
 * transcribed from the composition as it stood before the refactor, so the test
 * fails if a single tool or skill is added, dropped or renamed on the way.
 *
 * Read through the real composition on purpose: the registry via
 * `vendo.actions` (the one registry every door shares) and the skills via a
 * scripted harness's own `turn.skills.list()` (the mount IS the store — nothing
 * registers anywhere else).
