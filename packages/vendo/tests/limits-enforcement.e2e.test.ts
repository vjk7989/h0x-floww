/**
 * The host's limits, enforced over the REAL composition.
 *
 * Every case drives `createVendo(...)` — real store, real meter, real guard,
 * real registry, a real HTTP `Request` into `vendo.handler` — because the thing
 * worth proving is that a composed deployment enforces the host's verdict, and
 * a unit test of the limiter cannot tell you a hot path ever calls it.
 *
 * The model is SCRIPTED and its call count is an assertion, not a detail: the
 * whole promise of the message choke is that a denied turn costs nothing, and
 * "the reply looked right" is compatible with having paid for a turn first.
 *
 * The card is parsed with `vendoLimitPartSchema` off `@vendoai/core` — the same
 * schema the chat surface reads it through. A hand-written expectation here
 * would let the producer and the consumer drift apart with the suite green.
