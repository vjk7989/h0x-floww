/**
 * Docs-rot gate for the BYO story. The docs live in this repo, so this is a
 * plain test against the sources — it reads files and nothing else, no package
 * import, so it runs without a build.
 *
 * The Cloud restructure moved every page this gate watched and re-split the
 * facts across new homes, one canonical home per fact. Every claim below still
 * bites; each is now pinned on the page whose job that fact is. Move a fact
 * between pages and move its constant here.
 *
 * What it holds, and why each claim is load-bearing:
 *  1. both door-1 walkthroughs are published and every nav entry still
 *     resolves, with the chooser FIRST in its group and pointing at both of
 *     them (every inbound link — landing cards, README, init receipts — names
 *     the chooser's slug, so a reader who lands there has to be routed on);
 *  2. every tool name the docs put in front of a reader's model really exists
 *     in the registry the page is describing;
 *  3. `vendo_make`'s four arguments are its real schema properties on BOTH
 *     doors, and the asymmetry — that the IN-PROCESS pack carries no
 *     `vendo_apps_*` — matches pack.ts. That asymmetry is the one thing a
 *     reader can silently get wrong (an invented tool call), so it is pinned
 *     from both sides;
 *  4. the receipt really carries the fields the envelope table calls a law;
 *  5. every component the docs tell a reader to import is really exported from
 *     the entry point they name;
 *  6. every internal link, on every page in the tree, points at a page that
 *     really exists. Redirects do not count: they exist for links the world
 *     already published, and one of ours that needs one is a stale link.
