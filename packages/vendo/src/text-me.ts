/**
 * `vendo_text_me` — one text to the person the run is FOR, from any surface.
 *
 * It exists because the text channel could only ever answer: a conversation the
 * user started, in the turn they started it. Everything that wants to reach them
 * later — an away automation, a web turn that finishes after they have closed the
 * tab — had nothing to call, so the channel's own grounding told the model to
 * point at the app and promise "coming soon" (channel-turn.ts). This is the other
 * half: the action an automation holds a grant for, so "text me when the rent
 * clears" is armed once and delivered forever.
 *
 * MISUSE RESISTANCE IS THE SHAPE, not a check: the input is `{ text }` and
 * nothing else. There is no number to pass, so no model output can aim a text at
 * a phone that is not the current subject's own — the destination is read from
 * the link row under `ctx.principal`, which only ever exists because that signed-in
 * user asked for it and texted a code back (channel-links.ts).
 *
 * Consent is the existing machinery, untouched: a `write` descriptor on the one
 * registry, so a present turn parks a card under whatever the host's policy says,
 * and an away firing needs the standing grant that arming mints (automations
 * `grants.ts`). No new consent path, no per-tool allowlist.
