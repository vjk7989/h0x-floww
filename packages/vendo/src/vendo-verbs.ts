   *  written against it and could not be applied without it. Absent is what every
   *  caller that has no ask to hand over passes, and it reads exactly as it always
   *  did: no ask, no carve-out.
   *
   *  `viewport` is the surface the screen renders into, in CSS pixels, from the
   *  same gate — the fact the writer was given and the reviewer was not. With it
   *  the reviewer is shown the screen's first paint framed by those pixels, so
   *  content below the fold or behind a later step stops reading like content on
   *  screen. Absent, the reviewer's prompt is unchanged.
   *
   *  `ctx` is the CALLER's, handed down from `execute` — never assembled by the
   *  port and never taken from the model's input. Both of the app-touching verbs
   *  are owner-scoped behind it, so a model naming someone else's appId gets a
   *  not-found rather than a look at their app. */
