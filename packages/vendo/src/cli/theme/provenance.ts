/**
 * Theme provenance — how `vendo sync` re-extracts a rebrand without ever
 * clobbering a hand edit.
 *
 * `.vendo/theme.json` is the editable source of truth and stays exactly the
 * frozen `VendoTheme` shape, so provenance rides a sibling merge base:
 * `.vendo/theme.extracted.json` records what the DETERMINISTIC scan produced
 * the last time it ran. That mirrors the split `.vendo/` already lives by —
 * `tools.json`/`judgments.json` are the machine layer, `overrides.json` is
 * "what a person decided" — instead of inventing a second convention.
 *
 * The law is one line: a slot is machine-owned ONLY when the base records it
 * and `theme.json` still holds exactly that value. Everything else is pinned.
 *   • recorded and unchanged → machine-extracted; a new extraction updates it
 *   • recorded and different → hand-edited; pinned and reported
 *   • not recorded at all (no base file yet, or a token init never saw) →
 *     pinned, because there is no evidence about who chose the value on disk
 *
 * That last rule is deliberately conservative. An earlier draft treated "the
 * value equals Vendo's neutral default" as proof the machine wrote it — but
 * the neutral defaults are ordinary Tailwind palette values (`#2563eb` is
 * blue-600, the greys are the slate ramp), so a human who picks blue-600 would
 * have had it silently overwritten. Unprovable ownership is never ownership.
 *
 * The base only advances on an unambiguous run (no pinned slots), so an
 * install from before the base existed warns with the diff on every sync until
 * a human resolves it with `--theme-refresh` — never quietly adopting a stale
 * value as the new truth.
