/**
 * `vendo init` (install-dx v1, re-derived 2026-07-18): one command, the
 * up-front questions, no ceremony.
 *
 *   scan → ask → wire (the server surface — the composition module
 *   `lib/vendo.ts` and the catch-all handler over it; init never writes a
 *   client file; plus package.json hooks) → key (env stated, else the cloud
 *   starter offer) → facts.
 *
 * INIT ONLY EVER CREATES FILES IN YOUR SOURCE TREE (locked DX law). Everything
 * above is a NEW Vendo-owned file, or Vendo-owned config: `package.json`'s two
 * sync hooks, and one idempotent append of `VENDO_BASE_URL` to `.env.example`
 * (the only pre-existing host-authored file init still writes, and it appends
 * — it never rewrites a line). A source file that already exists is never
 * written at all, however stale: mounting the visible surface in the host's own
 * layout, wiring `serverActions` into a route that predates the host's actions,
 * refreshing a stale registration map. `vendo doctor` grades every one of them
 * (E-WIRE-004, E-WIRE-009) and each code's page carries the fix.
 *
 * IT PRINTS NO CODE AND NO STEPS. Every snippet it used to print — the mount
 * paste, the loop wiring, the MCP steps — was a second copy of something the
 * docs already carry, and a terminal cannot keep a copy correct. The run ends
 * on facts and ONE URL (`printFacts`); `--agent` gets the same as JSON.
 *
 * Removed by design: the interview, per-diff y/N approvals, the lib/ai.ts
 * scaffold (createVendo's `model` is optional now), remix offers, the
 * encryption-key step, the refine offer (the `vendo refine` command itself is
 * gone — format v3 replaces it with the enrichment pass), the finale ceremony,
 * and the doctor check (doctor is a standalone command, and init's exit code is
 * about init's own work).
