/**
 * Push the registered-component corpus `vendo sync` captured to Vendo Cloud, so
 * the console's Apps gallery renders the host's own components for real instead
 * of a grey labeled placeholder.
 *
 * WHAT CROSSES THE WIRE: the source of every component the host registers in
 * `<VendoProvider components={…}>`, the source of every module in each component's
 * import closure, and the app-root stylesheets. Package code never does (the
 * capture stops at node_modules). It happens only when a Vendo Cloud key
 * resolves AND the project said yes once (`.vendo/cloud.json`) — keyless / BYO
 * makes no request at all.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, in two halves, and the split is what makes the push cheap:
 *
 *  - RECORDS `vendo_host_components` — id = component name, data =
 *    `CapturedHostComponent`: refs, no source, a few hundred bytes. Listing the
 *    collection IS the hash manifest; there is no manifest row to drift from
 *    the truth.
 *  - BLOBS `vendo_host_components` — key = the module's sha-256 hex, body =
 *    `{ source, imports? }` JSON. `blobs.list()` returns KEYS ONLY, so one call
 *    answers "which of my hashes do you already have?" without downloading a
 *    byte of source. Content addressing means a key that exists is by
 *    definition current.
 *
 * An unchanged second sync therefore costs two calls and uploads nothing.
