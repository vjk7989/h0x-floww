/**
 * Gateway fuel: the env overlay that makes Claude Code (any rung that reads
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL / ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN / ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS — the
 * PATH `claude` binary today, the npx-fetched engine package tomorrow)
 * speak to the Vendo Cloud model gateway instead of Anthropic directly, when
 * the dev has no Anthropic credential of their own but does have
 * VENDO_API_KEY. Own credential always wins — this module never overrides
 * it, and callers must never call it when one is available.
 *
 * INVARIANT: a non-blank ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN, CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, or
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL in the passed env IS an own credential (the corporate-
 * gateway / custom-endpoint path Claude Code also supports, none of which
 * show up in a `claude auth status` login probe) and always wins, even if a
 * caller mistakenly passes `ownCredentialAvailable: false`. Overwriting a
 * dev's already-configured BYO endpoint would silently redirect their
 * inference through Vendo's gateway and bill their org's meter — this
 * module checks it directly rather than trusting callers to remember.
 *
 * That invariant is about the DEVELOPER's own endpoint, and for
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (see AGENT_ENDPOINT_ENV_VAR) it holds only because a
 * project file can no longer supply one: `readEnvFiles` in sync-flow.ts
 * drops the key from `.env`/`.env.local`, at the one point where file-vs-
 * shell provenance is still known. By the time any env reaches this module
 * the key can only have come from the developer's shell or a programmatic
 * caller, so "is it set" and "did the developer choose it" are the same
 * question again — which is why a flat env map is enough to answer it here.
 *
 * The gateway must be able to refuse this traffic for free-plan orgs
 * (spec's free-plan policy), so every request gets tagged with the
 * INIT_PURPOSE_HEADER — a plain "name: value" line via Claude Code's
 * ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS mechanism. The constant is the single source of
 * truth; the console mirrors the literal in its own tests (plan Task 7).

 * sends by default. Claude Code passes a custom model id through verbatim once
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL points at a non-Anthropic endpoint (verified against
 * claude 2.1.220), so pinning ANTHROPIC_MODEL to the gateway's own extraction
 * id lands every rung on a valid gateway id — no gateway contract change. This
 * is the extraction role of the gateway's model family (vendo-extract, see
 * vendo-web console lib/api/model-aliases.ts VENDO_MODEL_FAMILY); a dev's
