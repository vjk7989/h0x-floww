/**
 * Last-resort extraction harness: nothing Claude-shaped is installed on the
 * dev's machine (no Agent SDK, no `claude` binary, no `codex` binary), but
 * they do have a usable credential — so init fetches Claude Code itself via
 * `npm exec` rather than degrading straight to the honest skip. This is the
 * fourth and final rung of the ladder in extraction.ts.
 *
 * Child contract: `npm exec --yes @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<PINNED_VERSION>`
 * runs Anthropic's published `claude` binary in the same headless, read-only
 * shape as the PATH rung (claude-cli-harness.ts) — prompt on argv via `-p`,
 * Read/Glob/Grep only and each one scoped to the host root by a permission
 * rule (confine-to-root.ts), `--setting-sources ""`, credentials on the
 * child's process env, stdout is the agent's final text, exit 0 = success. The
 * version is pinned exact (never a range) so this rung's behavior can't
 * drift out from under init on a machine with no local install to pin
 * instead.
 *
 * Availability deliberately never touches npm or the network — it is called
 * eagerly for every rung on every `vendo init`, and a probe here would mean
 * every init pays an npm-registry round trip just to build the "AI polish?"
 * prompt. The ~250MB download surprise is disclosed instead via the
 * run-time notice below, right before the first real network access.
 *
 * Gateway fuel: mirrors claude-cli-harness.ts — when the dev has none of
 * ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN, CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, or
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (the corporate-gateway/custom-endpoint path) but
 * VENDO_API_KEY is set, the child runs against Vendo Cloud's model gateway
 * instead of degrading to unavailable (see gateway-fuel.ts). Own credential
 * always wins — availability() must label these honestly (not as "Vendo
 * Cloud key") since composeGatewayFuel itself refuses to overlay onto any of
 * them; a wrong label here would make the consent prompt lie about what
 * run() actually does. As on the PATH rung, the base URL that counts is the
 * developer's own (shell or an explicit programmatic env) — a project's
 * `.env` cannot supply one, because sync-flow.ts's readEnvFiles drops it
 * before any env reaches this rung.
