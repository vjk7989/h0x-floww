/**
 * Agent-install DX (design 2026-07-19 §CLI-3) — the doctor error-code
 * registry. Every failure mode doctor can report has one stable, grep-able
 * code here: E-<AREA>-<NNN>, where the area groups related checks (WIRE
 * wiring, CFG config files, STORE store persistence, DEP host dependency
 * versions, MCP door, CLOUD key, TOOLS catalog). Codes are
 * append-only: never renumber or reuse one — the verify page anchors
 * (`fix_ref`) and agents' remediation notes depend on them staying put. A
 * check that goes away leaves its entry behind, marked RETIRED, for the same
 * reason. Doctor reads only what is on disk, so every code that needed a
 * running app to observe (DEV, LIVE, AUTH, TURN, SCHED and the fetched half
 * of MCP) is retired below.
 *
 * This is the ONE module a CI check enumerates to assert every code has a
 * matching verify-page anchor (no registry rot).
 *
 * An AREA groups checks, not severities: E-MODEL-001 is a WARNING (doctor still
 * exits 0 — a host may keep its key outside the files doctor can read), and it
 * carries a code for the same reason every other finding does, so an agent can
 * grep it and follow the fix_ref.
