/**
 * `vendo.tokenFor` — one short-lived, user-bound MCP access token for a
 * backend agent to connect to this deployment's door as that user.
 *
 * ONE function for both postures, because agent code is posture-portable: a
 * Cloud deployment exchanges its provisioned service key at the tenant broker,
 * a BYO one exchanges `mcp.serviceAuth` at the door's own `/token`, and the
 * caller gets the same `vmat_…` back either way. Both legs are the SAME RFC
 * 8693 form POST — the local one rides `vendo.handler`, so it goes through the
 * door's real token endpoint (and its schema latch) without the deployment
 * having to be able to reach itself over the network.
