/**
 * Per-user limits: Vendo counts, the host decides.
 *
 * The host's `limits` callback is asked once before each metered action and its
 * verdict is honored. Everything else about a limit lives HERE — reading the
 * meter, invoking the policy, recording what an allow spent, and the fail mode —
 * so a choke point is one `gate` call and can never grow its own half of the
 * rule.
 *
 * The fail mode is the load-bearing decision: a policy that throws DENIES. A
 * limits system that fails open stops limiting silently, so the host keeps
 * believing they have a cap while every user is unlimited — strictly worse than
 * a turn that was refused and said so.
