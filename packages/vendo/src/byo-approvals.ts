/**
 * Existing-agents Lane B — parked guarded calls with NO Vendo thread and NO app.
 *
 * A `vendo_*` pack tool executing in a BYO agent loop returns the
 * `vendo/approval-ref@1` envelope the instant the guard answers
 * `pending-approval` — no throw, no block. But nothing in the host's loop ever
 * re-dispatches the call: the thread resume path (`data-vendo-approval` stream
 * parts) needs Vendo's conversation, and the apps runtime's `ParkedAction`
 * pins an `appId` and lives with the app. This seam is the venue-neutral
 * third venue, riding the same three existing mechanisms end to end:
 *
 * - PARK: the {@link ByoApprovals.registry} decorator records the EXACT call
 *   (guard-minted id, tool, args) plus its `RunContext` when a guarded execute
 *   returns `pending-approval` — the same shape as `ParkedAction`, minus the
 *   app pin.
 * - RESUME: an umbrella-level `guard.onApprovalDecision` subscriber (the SAME
 *   seam the apps runtime and automations ride) re-dispatches the parked call
 *   byte-for-byte through the guard-bound registry on approve — the guard's
 *   one-shot approved replay pins subject, call id, args hash, descriptor
 *   hash, venue, presence, and appId, so the stored ctx is reused verbatim.
 *   Deny clears the record and never executes (fail closed).
 * - EXPIRE: {@link ByoApprovals.sweepExpired} denies parked calls older than
 *   the TTL through the existing abandonment path (`guard.abandonApprovals`
 *   semantics: deny + clear, idempotent) — a new trigger, not new semantics.
 *
 * The resume outcome persists keyed by approvalId so the wire can answer
 * "what happened to apr_x?" for `<VendoApprovalEmbed>` — in-thread that answer
 * rides the thread stream; there is no thread here.
