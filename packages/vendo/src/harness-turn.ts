 * The composition seam that turns a `Harness` into a served turn.

 * is anything that needs a `RunContext`, because a harness is permission-blind by
 * contract (§1). That leaves exactly this file's job: resolve the per-turn things
 * from the request's principal — the thread, the workspace, the `/host`
