/**
 * The closed list of `createVendo` top-level keys, and where each one is going.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SOURCE FILE AND NOT A TEST FIXTURE. The docs-rot gate used to
 * pin the same list inside `handler-options.docs.test.ts`, with an `AssertNever`
 * meant to fail compilation if the interface grew a key the list did not have.
 * It never ran: `packages/vendo/tsconfig.json` excludes `src/**\/*.test.ts` from
 * typecheck, so the assertion was compiled by nothing and the list silently
 * drifted ten keys behind the interface. Living here it is inside the typecheck
 * include, so the compile-time half of the gate is real.
 *
 * Three checks hang off this one list, and each can fail on its own:
 *   1. typecheck — the list and `keyof CreateVendoConfig` are asserted equal in
 *      BOTH directions below;
 *   2. `handler-options.docs.test.ts` — the docs-site composition table lists
 *      exactly these keys;
 *   3. the same test — the §10 migration table states a destination for each.
 *
 * It also does real work at runtime: {@link warnDeprecatedConfigKeys} is what
 * tells a host on the old shape where the key went.
