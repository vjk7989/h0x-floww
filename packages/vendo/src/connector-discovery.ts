/**
 * The connector-discovery tools, projected as ordinary tools on the one registry
 * — so the guard, the audit trail and every door treat them exactly like a host
 * tool. There is no privileged side door.
 *
 * The tool LISTING never changes (connector-discovery design 2026-08-03). A
 * broker's catalog is tens of thousands of tools and no client re-lists mid
 * session, so the catalog is not reached by growing the list: `find_service_tools`
 * returns each match WITH its argument schema, and `use_service_tool` runs one by
 * the broker's own slug. These four names are permanent, and a tool the model
 * found a moment ago is callable on the same turn.
 *
 * CONNECTING is still a UI act — only the person can complete a consent screen,
 * and the connect card is where they do it. What `request_connection` changes is
 * WHO STARTS IT: the agent may now ASK, in its own words, as soon as it knows the
 * request needs a service this user has not connected — with or without that
 * service's tools on its listing. The tool mints exactly the `connect-required`
 * outcome a refused call would have produced, so the card the user sees is the
 * same card — it just no longer costs a failed call to reach.
 *
 * The four names themselves live in core: the loadout reads them too, and none of
 * them carries the `vendo_*` prefix its always-active exemption keys on.
