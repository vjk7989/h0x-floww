/**
 * The closure `createVendo` used to be.
 *
 * 09-vendo §2 composes eleven blocks around one guard choke point, and it did
 * that inside a single 2,000-line function whose bindings all reached each
 * other by scope. This interface is that closure, named: every phase module
 * below takes the composition, reads the fields it needs, and returns its own
 * slice of it. `createComposition` wires the phases in the SAME order the one
 * function ran them, because the order is load-bearing (a boot warning, a
 * refusal, and three registry `add`s all have to land where they landed).
 *
 * A handful of fields are filled LATER than the phase that declares them —
 * the app-tool risk resolver, the learned loopback origin, the MCP posture.
 * They were `let` bindings read from closures that only run inside a request;
 * they are mutable fields here, read the same way, at the same time.
 *
 * Internal — not exported from the package root.
