/* ADAPTER RULE, inference seam: the agent and apps blocks consume one ai-SDK
   LanguageModel; which implementation composes is decided at resolveModels
   (models-config.ts). Precedence per slot: an explicitly passed model object
   always wins (BYO-LLM) → env pin (VENDO_MODEL / VENDO_MODEL_<SLOT>) →
   `models` string → the per-rung default. Every string rides vendoModel()'s
   env ladder, whose rungs live INSIDE it (resolveDevCredential): VENDO_API_KEY
   via @ai-sdk/anthropic pointed at the Cloud model gateway (`<console>/api/v1`
   — Anthropic-compatible /messages), then the honest keyless failure with exact
   instructions on first use. A provider key (ANTHROPIC / OPENAI / GOOGLE) in
   the environment selects NOTHING — the selection law: keys are credentials,
   `models` selects. vendoModel is the one seam-sanctioned lazy env resolver;
   every other adapter still never reads the environment. */
