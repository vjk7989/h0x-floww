/**
 * Design §4 — questions are a tool, one door, any seat.
 *
 * A question is TURN-ENDING, not a blocking mid-turn card. Build contract §8 cuts
 * steering (mid-turn user input), and design §6 has the builder "ask the user
 * through the one door if genuinely ambiguous, and dies". So the door does three
 * things and owns no machinery:
 *
 *  1. **It records the question.** The runtime mirrors every `turn.tools.call`
 *     into the transcript and the guard writes its audit row, so the question and
 *     its choices are already durable the moment the call returns. A separate
 *     pending-question registry would be a second copy of the transcript.
 *  2. **It ends the turn** (`askedUserStop`, loop.ts). Carrying on without the
 *     answer is exactly the invention this tool exists to prevent.
 *  3. **The answer arrives as the next turn's message.** That is why there is no
 *     wire part, no answer door and no renderer: the reply is an ordinary user
 *     message, and the next turn reads it out of the canonical transcript like
 *     anything else.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `collect` seam. Awaiting a person INSIDE a tool call is
 * the blocking card §8 cuts: it needs a wire part core does not have (§1.6 freezes
 * stream-parts.ts), and it holds a turn — and, for a boxed harness, a machine —
 * open on a human's attention.
