/**
 * What the ONE thinker is told, and how it finds the rest.
 *
 * The system-prompt inputs (03 §3's one prose story, the theme line, the
 * knowledge index) and the two discovery rails were written twice — once for a
 * `createAgent` that no longer exists, once for the harness runtime. They are
 * defined ONCE here and handed to the runtime below.
 *
 * The host COMPONENT list is no longer one of them: this thinker renders nothing,
 * and what a writer is told about the host's components is the briefing pack
 * (`contract/briefing.ts`), which is now the only rendering of that list there is.
 * The theme LINE stays — the pack hands the screen agent the tokens verbatim, so
 * a sentence about the brand here is a different thing for a different reader,
 * not a second copy.
