/**
 * The screen agent — UI-generation blueprint §4.2 and §4.5.
 *
 * It is `vendo()` with a CLOSED loadout and a tight step budget, not a harness of
 * its own: the assembly verbs and the host's read tools by name, two hands of its
 * own, and one door out. There is no second drive of `startTurn` here — the step
 * cap, the seat resolution, `wireErrorMessage`, the history knobs and the system
 * precedence are the default harness's, so a rail cannot be fixed in one loop and
 * stay broken in the other. What this file holds is the CONFIGURATION: the brief,
 * the loadout, the hands, and the outcome the front door reads.
 *
 * - **The write path is `turn.workspace`.** The `claudeCode()` harness already
 *   builds apps this way: the model writes the app with its own hands and the
 *   runtime's commit is what makes it real (`claude-code/index.ts:338`,
 *   `skills/building-apps.ts:68`). This agent has no disk and no shell, so its two
 *   writing hands over the same `WorkspaceFs` — the whole screen, or one exact
 *   passage of it — write `app.tsx` and nothing else, through one commit path.
 * - **The run's closing words are the receipt.** The loop reports what it built in
 *   its own voice, grounded in what its saves told it: whether the paint happened,
 *   and what each query delivered. `vendo_make` relays those words verbatim
 *   (`make-receipt.ts`), so nothing downstream describes a screen it never saw.
 * - **The paint path is the render seam.** `wrapWorkspaceForRender` intercepts
 *   `commit()`, compiles, and emits `data-vendo-view`. This file never emits a
 *   view and never compiles anything — that is exactly why a screen it assembles
 *   passes the same floor a `claudeCode()` app does.
 * - **`vendo_make` is withheld, not merely unused.** The screen agent IS what
 *   `vendo_make` calls, so leaving it callable is a loop. The closed loadout
 *   excludes it by omission.
 * - **The job description is the shipped skill.** `buildingAppsSkill` plus its
 *   `references/format.md` are the same text `claudeCode()` reads. This file adds
 *   one short block that corrects the ENVIRONMENT (no disk, no delegation, one
 *   file, one door out) rather than restating the job — a third prompt is the
 *   thing §0 forbids.
 *
 * Screens run UNSANDBOXED, by §6.5: a description is data, its props are
 * schema-validated, and the kit treats them as inert. There is no box here.

 * about to keep — which is exactly what the reviewer is for. Its mechanical half
 * already ran as the paint gate, so this spends the model call and nothing else.
 *
 * `validateWrittenApps` is the gate: it reads `app.tsx` back out of the
 * workspace and checks it as text. A screen is not text a checker can read twice —
 * its data comes from EXECUTING it — so the verb takes the app id, and the answer is
 * relayed as {@link refusal} writes one, so the loop reads one kind of finding
 * whichever check produced it.
 *
 * THE ASK TRAVELS WITH IT. Two of the reviewer's five things — a section nobody
 * asked for, work quietly dropped — are written against the person's own words, and
 * the verb had no field to carry them, so those two rules were dead text on every
 * screen this gate ever judged. This loop is holding the ask (it is message 1 of
 * every drive), so it hands it over verbatim.
 *
 * AND SO DOES THE SURFACE. The writer was told what it was writing into
 * (`surfaceNote`) and the reviewer was not, so it judged the file and never the
 * shape: a third table below the fold and a step behind a click read to it exactly
 * like content on the person's screen. The same loop holds both facts, so it hands
 * over both.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, exactly like that gate: every way this could not reach a verdict is
 * reported to the operator and to nobody else. A reviewer that could not judge must
 * never be the reason a good screen dies.

    tells you exactly what to fix.
  - It also tells you what the person's screen actually GOT: whether the save
    painted, and what each of your queries delivered.
  - Its \`decisions\` is this app's MEMORY, and the only thing the next editor will
    have besides the file. Record what reading the file could not tell them — why
    you narrowed something, a constraint the tools imposed, a shape you ruled out.
  - Never record what you did or in what order; that is narration, and it crowds
    out the one line that mattered.
- **\`${EDIT_APP_TOOL}\`** replaces exact passages of the file you already saved.
  - Fixing errors? Send edits, not a rewrite — all of them in one call, and they
    land together or not at all.
  - Quote the text that goes in each \`find\`, write what replaces it in
    \`replace\`, and quote enough of it to match in exactly one place —
    everything the person is already looking at then stays where it is.
  - It lands and is checked exactly like a save.${doorOut(input)}

## Your last words are what the person is told

- Say what they now have IN THE SAME MESSAGE as your last save — the words and
  the save that finishes the screen travel in one turn, and a turn spent only to
  speak is a turn the person sits through.
- One or two plain sentences, in their words, and nothing after it.
- Those exact words are what the assistant repeats to them, so they can only
  claim what your saves reported: what painted, and what each query delivered —
  which is the other reason to save as you go, so the save you speak beside holds
  no surprises.
- If a query brought back no data or a save never reached the screen, say that
  plainly instead of describing the part that is blank.

## This product's tools your screen can CALL, but you cannot call here

- The screen calls one as \`tools.<name>(args)\` from an event handler, and that is
  the only way an app of yours changes anything.

      // the only moment either copy should move.

      // run ever used it, and that is DATA LOSS with a green test in front of it:
      // a failed re-seed leaves the host's new port sitting in the workspace, the
      // next ordinary edit opens that instead of the person's screen, and saves it
      // over the top. The row-level guarantee still passes the whole time, because
      // the loss happens a turn later. Proven: re-add the commit and
      // `remix-port-seed.e2e.test.ts`'s re-seed guarantee goes red on the
      // workspace half.

      // save, and a save is newer than the row. Showing it is not writing it.

      // §3.2 is what makes that the right way round: a landed save wrote both, so
      // they agree, and where they do not the ROW is the truth — it is the screen
      // the person is actually looking at. The way they part is a save the floor
      // refused, which reaches the workspace (`persistSource`) but never the row.
