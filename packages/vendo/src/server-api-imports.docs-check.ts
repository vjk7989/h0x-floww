/**
 * The import block `docs-site/reference/server-api.mdx` publishes — compiled.
 *
 * That page used to import each type from its owning block package
 * (`@vendoai/core`, `@vendoai/apps`, …), which is a TS2307 in a real host: a
 * host depends on `@vendoai/vendo`, not on the blocks, and pnpm's strict
 * linking makes that gap fatal. The page now imports from the umbrella, and
 * this file is the proof that every name it lists is actually re-exported
 * from the entry the page names.
 *
 * A package cannot resolve itself by name, so the doc's `@vendoai/vendo`
 * becomes `./index.js` here and `@vendoai/vendo/server` becomes
 * `./server.js`. Nothing else differs.
