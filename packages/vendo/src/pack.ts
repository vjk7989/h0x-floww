 * (runvendo/flowlet#822 defect 2, generalized) — an id and a title are the whole
 * shape of "this exists and is fine". Returning null here lets the caller fall
 * back to the receipt itself, `status` and `say` intact.
 *
 * `"partial"` is refused for the same reason and it is not the same case: the app
 * EXISTS, and the half of it the plan asked a server for does not. A ref says
 * "accepted, still streaming, NOT built yet" and carries neither field, so
 * laundering a partial receipt through it leaves a caller waiting on a completion
 * that already came, and drops the one sentence that says what is missing.
 *
 * An offered BUILD needs no clause here: it is a `pending-approval` outcome now,
 * so it never reaches a receipt at all.
 *
 * Local to the PACK on purpose. `vendo/app-ref@1` means "accepted, still
 * streaming, NOT built yet"; only this fast-return path can honestly say that.
 * The MCP door runs `vendo_make` to completion, so it answers the receipt — see
