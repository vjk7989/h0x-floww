 *  `vendo_text_me` is here for the OTHER reason, and it is the first honoring of
 *  a contract nothing implemented: types.ts's `loadout` doc says "Vendo's own
 *  `vendo_*` tools are always active" and no code ever made it so. Maple's away
 *  surface is 25 reads and 6 writes, so the 24-tool safest-first slice evicts
 *  EVERY write — twice in two days (2026-08-18/19) an automation armed with a
 *  live Text me grant answered "I don't have a way to send a text message". A
 *  granted power the belt hides is a lie the person who granted it cannot see.
 *  Restoring the whole contract belongs to the loadout redesign; the one tool
 *  that broke production does not wait for it.
 *
 *  `vendo_automate` joins it for the first reason AND the second. The text
 *  channel's hidden grounding names the automation path on every single inbound
 *  text — "to text the user later, set up an automation for it" (channel-turn.ts
 *  TEXT_STYLE) — and arming is a write, so the same safest-first cut that buried
 *  Text me made the one thing this channel advertises cost a `find_tools` round
 *  on the first turn of every fresh thread. The exemption rides ON TOP of the
 *  cap rather than raising it, so the offered set stays inside the 30-50 band
 *  where selection accuracy is best (tool-search.ts).
 *
 *  A name with nothing behind it costs nothing: `computeInitialLoadout` filters
 *  the turn's OWN listings through this set (tool-search.ts), so on a deployment
 *  that never opted into texts it simply never matches — no `channels` gate. */
