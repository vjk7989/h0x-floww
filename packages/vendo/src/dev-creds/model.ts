/** The model-credential ladder moved to `@vendoai/harnesses/inference`, so the

 *  package. This file stays as vendo's door onto it: `#dev-creds/model` in
 *  package.json names this module for Node and `model-edge.ts` for the
 *  web-standard runtimes, and that condition is what keeps the Node ladder out
 *  of a Worker bundle (portability gate, FORBIDDEN_INPUTS). */
