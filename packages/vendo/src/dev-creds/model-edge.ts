/** Web-standard-runtime build of the dev credential ladder, selected by the
 *  package's `worker`/`workerd`/`edge-light`/`browser` import conditions
 *  (see `#dev-creds/model` in package.json).
 *
 *  The real ladder is Node by design: it resolves the host's own @ai-sdk
 *  provider install via createRequire from the project root, reads `vendo
 *  login` sessions off disk, and anchors on process.cwd(). None of that
 *  exists inside a Worker bundle — Mohamed's field report had the ladder
 *  dying on runtime require.resolve under Wrangler even with VENDO_API_KEY
 *  set. On these runtimes the model seam is explicit by contract: the host
 *  wiring constructs the provider (init generates it; the Cloud gateway is
 *  the stock Anthropic provider pointed at the console). The ladder's edge
 *  build therefore resolves to honest guidance instead of half-working
 *  magic. Keep this module free of node builtins and CLI imports; the
 *  portability gate bundles it. */
