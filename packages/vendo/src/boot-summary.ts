/**
 * The one block a deployment prints when `createVendo` finishes composing.
 *
 *     ◆  vendo ready
 *     │  ✓ sandbox   cloud    VENDO_API_KEY
 *     │  ✓ store     local    .vendo/data
 *     │  ✓ models    cloud    VENDO_API_KEY (gateway)
 *     │  ✓ auth      clerk    auth: clerk()
 *     │  ⚠ store     .vendo/data is under /tmp — data will not survive a redeploy.
 *     │              Mount a volume, or pass url: "postgres://…" to createVendo.
 *
 * Column 2 is the VENUE — which implementation the adapter rule chose. Column 3
 * is what chose it: the env variable, or the config line the host wrote. The
 * rows are the same facts `/status` reports (wire/misc.ts), said once, at boot,
 * to the operator instead of to a client.
 *
 * Two hard constraints:
 *
 *   1. COMPOSED FACTS ONLY. `createVendo` must stay I/O-free at module init for
 *      Workers portability (compose-store.ts's `selectFiles` note), so nothing
 *      here may stat a path, open a handle, or await anything. Every row is a
 *      property read off the finished composition or an env variable — including
 *      the ephemeral-disk judgment, which its OWNER makes (the store, at
 *      `createStore`) and hangs on the engine handle, so this block reads it
 *      like any other composed fact and renders it as a WARNING, which is data
 *      in `BootSummary`, not a special case in the renderer.
 *
 *   2. ONE BLOCK PER PROCESS. A dev server recomposes on nearly every request;
 *      this is a boot fact, not a per-request one (the same latch
 *      `reportHostedStoreOnce` uses).
