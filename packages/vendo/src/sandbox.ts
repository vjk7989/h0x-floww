/** The Cloud sandbox adapter — the OSS side of the managed-sandbox seam: the

 * routes (Vendo's pooled provider capacity, metered as sandbox_minutes). The
 * wire contract — the ARTIFACT model, verified live — lives in
 * sandbox-wire.ts. Cloned from cloudConnections' shape: behavior comes ONLY
 * from constructor arguments (adapter rule — see selectSandbox in server.ts);
 * the adapter never reads the environment.
 *
 * Provider particulars, versus the e2b reference port:
 * - Snapshots are persistent artifacts that survive the machine; resume
 *   boots a NEW machine from one (fork when the source lives, wake when it
 *   is gone) and inherits NO network config, so every resume sends the
 *   applicable allowlist explicitly — the ref-recorded one bare, the
 *   caller's SandboxResumePolicy when a wake re-polices (Lane E replace
 *   semantics, native on the wire).
 * - stop() destroys the machine: Cloud has no pause, and with artifacts
 *   surviving it, snapshot-then-destroy IS the sleep semantics; previously
 *   minted refs stay valid through it (the seam law).
 * - Composite refs: the seam sees `vendo:v2:<base64url state>` carrying the
 *   console artifact ref, the source machine id (destroy-by-ref reaps a
 *   still-running source best-effort before the artifact GC), and the
 *   snapshot-time allowlist a bare resume re-applies.
 * - `spec.template` is dropped from the wire: the create route takes none —
 *   the pooled base image (Node + the in-box agent) is Cloud's own.
 *
 * `files` is part of the public seam (apps/sandbox.ts), and the console's
 * list route may answer any depth — the adapter folds it to the seam's one
 * level. The machine object also carries adapter-private exec used for
 * live-lane bootstrap and diagnostics — NOT part of the seam (the in-box agent
 * owns the inside of the box). */
