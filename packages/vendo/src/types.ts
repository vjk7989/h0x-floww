  /** The agent's hands over the user's own files (spec 2026-08-23 §1): one
      in-process `bash` over the workspace, on the same guarded registry as
      everything else. ON by default — a deployment's users drop files into chat
      whether or not anyone configured anything, and an agent that cannot open
      them is the whole problem this exists to fix.

      `false` withholds the tool entirely. The object form keeps it and moves its
      ceilings: `limits.maxExecutionTimeMs` (default 30 000) is one call's wall
      clock, `limits.maxOutputBytes` (default 1 000 000) is how much one call may
      produce before the shell stops it.

      It rides the RESIDENT BRAIN, not the deployment: `vendo()` runs in this
      process and has the workspace in hand, so the tool composes for it and for
      an `agent()` that adopted it. A harness that thinks on a MACHINE
