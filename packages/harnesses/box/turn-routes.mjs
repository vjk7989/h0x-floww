/**
 * The box's `claudeCode()` SESSION door.
 *
 * The existing control port serves the layer-3 app builder (`/agent/*`). This
 * module adds the CONVERSATIONAL door beside it: materialize a workspace copy
 * ONCE, hold ONE Claude Agent SDK session open for the whole conversation, and
 * push each user message into it. Chat in, stream out — exactly like a terminal.
 *
 * **The tool bridge is gone.** It used to be INVERTED: `SandboxMachine.request()`
 * is the only data path INTO a box, so the host drove — post a message, poll;
 * when the model reached a projected tool the box PARKED the ask and handed it
 * out on the next poll; the host ran `turn.tools.call()` and posted the answer
 * back. cc-native measured whether our MCP door could replace that and it could
 * not; door-ctx made it (10-mcp §3b), so the session now reaches the host's
 * tools directly over remote MCP with a turn-scoped credential the host mints.
 *
 * What that deleted here: `callTool`, the per-message `asks` map, the
 * hand-out-once cursor bookkeeping, the `/session/{id}/answer` route, and the
 * tool FINGERPRINT that reopened a session whenever the equipped set changed —
 * the door lists live, so there is nothing to go stale.
 *
 * What it costs: the box now holds an OUTBOUND credential and needs egress to
 * the host's origin, where before it held nothing but a workspace copy, the
 * inference key and the inbound machine token. The credential is strictly
 * weaker than the bridge it replaces — the bridge could ask the host to run any
 * tool the turn could run, and so can this — but it is a real posture change
 * and it is recorded in the lane's close note.
 *
 * The poll loop STAYS: it is how the model's text, usage and `wrote` events
 * leave the box, and nothing about MCP changes that direction of travel.
 *
 * Everything interesting about the SDK loop lives in `claude-turn.mjs`, which is
 * the SAME module `machine: "local"` runs on the host — one implementation, two
 * homes.
 *
 * This file lives in `@vendoai/harnesses` (the claude-code driver's package —
 * the box-side half of the session protocol the driver speaks), but it RUNS in
 * the box: `packages/apps/box/build-template.mjs` stages it into the machine
 * image beside the supervisor, which delegates every `/session/*` request here.
 * It imports nothing but node builtins, so it works from either home.
