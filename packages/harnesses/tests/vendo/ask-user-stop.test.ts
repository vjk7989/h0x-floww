/**
 * Design §4 + §6 — a question through the one door ENDS the turn.
 *
 * The law's only direct tests lived in the umbrella's `ask-user.test.ts` and
 * drove `createAgent`; they died with it. The stop condition (`askedUserStop`)
 * lives beside this file now, so the proof does too.
 *
 * Both halves matter and they pull in opposite directions: an ANSWERED question
 * must stop the loop (carrying on is exactly the invention `ask_user` exists to
 * prevent — the model guesses an answer, and the user's real reply lands a turn
 * too late), while a REFUSED one must NOT (a blank or unattended question is not
 * an answer pending, and ending there strands work the model could still do).
 *
 * The registry here is hand-rolled rather than `boundRegistry`: the double wraps
 * whatever its implementation returns in `{status:"ok"}`, so a refusal would read
 * as answered and the second case could never fail.
