/**
 * The compaction state codec — what a thread remembers between turns.
 *
 * The slot is `turn.state` (build contract §1.3): ONE opaque string per thread,
 * written at turn end and handed back on the next turn. Opaque means the codec is
 * the only thing standing between a stored string and the loop's assumptions, and
 * the string can be older than this build: a slot written by a future version, or
 * by a different harness, or truncated by a store that lost half a row. Every one
 * of those reads as "no state" rather than as a shape the loop then trusts —
 * losing the state costs one un-compacted turn, and trusting a bad one costs a
 * prompt nobody can predict.
