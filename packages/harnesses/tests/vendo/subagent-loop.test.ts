/**
 * A hire rides the ONE loop.
 *
 * `runSubagent` used to open a second, bare `streamText` of its own, so every
 * rail `startTurn` owns — the stop conditions, the history assembly, the cache
 * breakpoints, the stated retry budget — stopped at the resident, and a hired
 * specialist ran without them. `vendo()`'s own docstring already claims the
 * opposite ("NOT a second loop"), and the hire was the one caller that made it
 * untrue.
 *
 * What this suite pins: a hire goes through `startTurn` (asserted by rails only
 * that loop has), it still cannot hire — both depth-1 locks — two hires still
 * run at the same time (full parallelism, writes included), and the turn's
 * usage events still partition it: the resident's own figure plus one event per
 * hire, which the runtime sums into the one run row.
