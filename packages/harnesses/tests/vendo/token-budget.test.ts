/**
 * A per-tenant token ceiling (§4.1 item 4).
 *
 * The loop's `stopWhen` was a hardcoded array literal — three conditions and no
 * seam — so a caller who needed a fourth had no way to add one and would have
 * had to build a second stop mechanism beside it. It takes extra conditions now,
 * and the ceiling is one member of that array rather than a new rail.
 *
 * Modelled on step-cap.test.ts: the scripted model carries exactly as many turns
 * as the run is allowed, so `doStreamCalls.length` — not a claim about intent —
 * is what proves the loop stopped.
