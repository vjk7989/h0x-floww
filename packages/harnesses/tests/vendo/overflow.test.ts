/**
 * A prompt that did not fit is recoverable — exactly once.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here and they are different in kind. The classifier is a
 * pattern set, and what matters about it is the line it draws: a provider saying
 * "your prompt is too big" must be told apart from a provider saying "you are
 * asking too often", because the answers are opposite — compact and continue
 * versus back off and stop. Bedrock formats a throttle as "Too many tokens,
 * please wait", which reads as an overflow to anyone matching on words alone, and
 * a turn that "recovers" from a rate limit by summarizing and calling again has
 * turned one 429 into two.
 *
 * The retry is the other half, and its whole design is in one sentence: the
 * second attempt CONTINUES the first. Every tool call the failed attempt made
 * went through `turn.tools.call()` and committed a real effect — a transfer, a
 * file, a build — so a retry that replays them performs each one twice. What the
 * first attempt produced therefore rides the next prompt verbatim, below the
 * compaction, and the only thing that changes between the two attempts is how
 * much history the projection carries.
