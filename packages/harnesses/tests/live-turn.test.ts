/**
 * `HarnessRuntimeDeps.liveTurn` — the runtime publishing the turn in flight to
 * the host process's own doors (the MCP door's turn credential, 10-mcp §3b).
 *
 * The load-bearing property is IDENTITY, not shape. The door answers a
 * turn-bearing call with `published.tools.call()`, and the parity gate's claim
 * that this mirrors to the transcript and runs `workspace.commit()` rests
 * entirely on that being the SAME object the harness holds as `turn.tools` —
 * the wrapper the runtime built, not the raw `createTurnTools` surface
 * underneath it, which mirrors but does not commit.
 *
 * A future refactor that hands the door a fresh `{ list, call }` façade would
 * pass every behavioural test in the parity gate and silently drop the commit,
 * so the identity is asserted directly.
