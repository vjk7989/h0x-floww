/**
 * Risk check (spec 2026-08-05 §2) — the [Context] block is assembled into
 * `turn.system` per turn and is supposed to live for THAT turn only. On this
 * harness the brief reaches the thinker exactly once: `local.ts` passes
 * `systemPrompt` to `createClaudeSession` and a warm session is reused for every
 * later `send()` without one (only a `reopen` truncation reopens it).
 *
 * So the FIRST turn's snapshot of the user's screen becomes the conversation's
 * standing system prompt, and every later turn's fresh situation is dropped.
 * That is both a staleness bug and the persistence the spec forbids: page
 * content captured on turn 1 keeps riding turns 2..n.
