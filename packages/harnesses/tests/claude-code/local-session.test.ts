/**
 * `machine: "local"` holds ONE session per thread — and must re-point it at each
 * new turn's sinks.
 *
 * The bug this file exists for, measured live 2026-08-02: the session is opened
 * on the FIRST message and reused after, so it captured that first turn's `emit`
 * closure. Turn 2's text was then delivered to turn 1's event queue, which
 * nobody was draining any more, and the user's second message came back
 * completely EMPTY. The box path never had this bug because its `emit` routes
 * through whichever message is in flight; local mode has to do the same.
 *
 * (`callTool` was the other captured closure and is gone: tools reach the host's
 * MCP door now, so there is no per-turn tool sink left to mis-point.)
