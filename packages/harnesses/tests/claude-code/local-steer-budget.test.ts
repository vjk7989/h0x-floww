/**
 * `machine: "local"` had no message budget, and a steer that the SDK answers
 * with FEWER results than the session counted wedged the whole thread.
 *
 * **The seam, and why this file doubles the SDK rather than the session.**
 * `createClaudeSession` (`claude-code/claude-turn.ts`) counts the extra `result`
 * messages a steer is expected to produce, and `local.ts` awaits `send()` until
 * one of them settles the turn. Those are a producer and a consumer of the same
 * invariant, and every existing test doubles one of them:
 *
 *   - `local-session.test.ts` doubles the whole `ClaudeSession`, so its `steer`
 *     has no counter at all;
 *   - `claude-session.test.ts` doubles the SDK with a loop that yields exactly
 *     one `result` per user message it reads — which IS the counter's
 *     assumption, so the double can never disagree with it.
 *
 * So the counter's one-sidedness had no honest test anywhere. Here the session is
 * REAL and only the SDK — genuinely a third party — is a double, and it answers
 * the way `ClaudeSession.steer`'s own doc says the SDK behaves: the steered words
 * are handed to the model at its next step boundary and ride the SAME turn, so
 * the turn produces ONE result, not two.
 *
 * Against that, the count is one too high: the final `result` decrements the
 * counter instead of settling the turn, and `send()` never resolves. The counter
 * is safe in the other direction (a surplus result merely settles early, which is
 * the trap it was built for) — it is only the SHORTFALL that hangs, and
 * `createClaudeSession.interrupt` already names that hazard: "the results the
 * steers were counting on may never arrive … the caller's promise would hang to
 * the message budget". The box rung HAS that budget. This rung did not.
