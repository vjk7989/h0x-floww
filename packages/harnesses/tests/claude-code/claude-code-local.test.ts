/**
 * THE LOCAL LEG's door diagnostics — the half `claude-code.test.ts` cannot reach.
 *
 * That file drives the REAL box door over a fake transport, on purpose. The
 * local leg has no equivalent: `localMachine()` opens a live Claude Agent SDK
 * session, and the SDK is installed in this repo, so draining a
 * `machine: "local"` turn would spawn the real CLI. So this file — and only this
 * file — doubles `./local.js`. What is under test is `index.ts`'s branch, not
 * where the workspace lands, and the double implements the same `SessionMachine`
 * port the real one does.
 *
 * The behaviour pinned here is a REGRESSION guard. door-internal deleted the
 * old "claudeCode() has no MCP door" operator error because composition now
 * always mounts one — correct — but the surviving diagnostic only fired for a
 * BOX. A production deployment with no `VENDO_BASE_URL` running
 * `claudeCode({ machine: "local" })` therefore ran with none of the product's
 * actions and said NOTHING to anyone.
