 * "a regex set cannot be the authority for what a person
 * may read", because it admitted raw JSON and exceptions while deleting good
 * copy. Its replacement is a precedence ladder of trusted sources ending in OUR
 * OWN fixed sentence (`consentWords`), and beats have no rung above that one: no
 * host authors beat copy and there is nothing structured to synthesize from.
 *
