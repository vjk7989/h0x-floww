 * `data-vendo-*` parts (packages/core/src/stream-parts.ts — UNCHANGED; no new
 * wire format)". Harness adapters contain no wire code; this is the only file
 * that knows what a chunk looks like.
 *
 * The `data-vendo-*` parts are NOT written here: the view channel, the approval
 * card, the connect card, the build-failed banner and the citations part all come
 * from the shipped bridge (`guardedCall`/`previewApproval` in ./tool-bridge.ts),
 * so a harness turn produces the identical wire the legacy agent path produced.
 *
 * ONE addition, and deliberately NOT in core's stream-parts.ts: `status` (§1.5)
 * has no existing part and must be screen-only. The ai-SDK's own
 * `transient: true` data chunk is exactly "delivered to the client, never added
 * to message history", so a transient `data-vendo-status` is the native
 * mechanism rather than a persisted format. See VENDO_STATUS_PART.
