/**
 * ONE Claude Agent SDK session, port-injected — wave 2 lane E, rewritten by
 * door-ctx.
 *
 * This module is the SDK loop for `claudeCode()`, and it has TWO homes on
 * purpose:
 *
 *   - inside the box, copied into the template as `/opt/vendo-box/claude-turn.mjs`
 *     (`packages/apps/box/build-template.mjs` stages this package's compiled
 *     `dist/claude-code/claude-turn.js`), driven by the supervisor's session
 *     routes (`packages/harnesses/box/turn-routes.mjs`);
 *   - on the host, imported by `claude-code/local.ts` for `machine: "local"`.
 *
 * **The tools are the HOST's own MCP door now.** They used to be an in-process
 * MCP server this file BUILT — every handler round-tripping to the host over an
 * inverted HTTP bridge the host polled, because the door could not carry a
 * turn's accountability context. door-ctx taught it to (10-mcp §3b), so the
 * session simply points at `{ type: "http", url, headers: { Authorization } }`
 * with a credential scoped to the turn in flight. The door hands each call to
 * `turn.tools.call()` — one guard, one audit row, one mirror, one commit,
 * exactly like `vendo()`. Nothing executes box-side, and this file no longer
 * translates schemas, correlates calls, or knows what a tool IS.
 *
 * What died with the projection: the JSON-Schema→zod translation, the
 * hook/handler correlation queue that made exactly-once hold, the tool listing
 * itself (the door lists LIVE, so a tool `find_tools` equips mid-conversation
 * needs no session reopen), and the `callTool` port in both drivers.
 *
 * It therefore imports NOTHING — not even a sibling in this package — and, the
 * rule that matters, it never NAMES the Agent SDK. Whoever supplies the machine
 * supplies the SDK: the box door loads it from the machine image, `machine:
 * "local"` loads it from the optional peer that `@vendoai/harnesses` declares.
 * A module that named the package itself was reachable from every composed
 * host's build graph, and a bundler that folds `import(CONST)` then refused to
 * build a host that has no reason to install a ~250MB platform binary. Keep it
 * that way — the emitted `dist/claude-code/claude-turn.js` is copied verbatim
 * into a machine image.
 *
 * There is no local permission system left (design §3, "claudeCode() specifics";
 * harness-redesign D1). The session runs in `bypassPermissions` because the two
 * things that decide are elsewhere: the BOX is the permission for the box's own
 * hands (copies only, no credentials, domain-filtered egress at the provider's
 * network layer, reality happens at commit), and the DOOR is the permission for
 * host tools — the guard decides there, with the turn's own context, and a refusal
 * arrives as the tool's own in-band error text, which the model narrates and never
 * a throw. {@link DISALLOWED_TOOLS} is the only local tool law that survives.
 *
 * Two limits on how far the box's containment reaches.
 *
 * The egress half is weaker than it sounds: the provider filters by DOMAIN, so
 * an ordinary client is held to the allowlist and a client that omits SNI is
 * not (measured). The box is filtered, not jailed.
 *
 * And the containment is about a BOX at all, which this module's other home —
 * `machine: "local"` — does not have: there the same bypass is a real shell on
 * the host's own server, with no network boundary of any kind. The mode is an
 * explicit deployment opt-in and warns the operator on its first turn
 * (`claude-code/local.ts`), but nothing in THIS file makes it safe, and reading
 * the paragraph above as if it did is the mistake to avoid.

/** The whole of the local tool law, in three groups.
 *
 *  The PROVIDER-SIDE tools act on the vendor's own surfaces over the inference
 *  channel rather than through this host, which puts them outside the box and the
 *  door both — no guard, no audit row, no egress filter. (`Projects`' own
 *  `project_write` uploads a workspace file provider-side and its schema says the
 *  contents "never enter your context", so not even the transcript records what
 *  left; `ClaudeDesign` writes to a design server behind its own login.)
 *
 *  The SCHEDULING family leaves execution BEHIND: a cron job, remote trigger or
 *  wakeup outlives the turn that created it and fires with no turn to be
 *  accountable to, so whatever it then does passes no guard, lands no audit row and
 *  meets no egress filter. `CronDelete`/`CronList` are here for the other direction
 *  too — under `machine: "local"` the schedules on that disk are the OPERATOR's,
 *  and a tenant's turn may neither enumerate nor destroy them.
 *
 *  `disallowedTools` removes them from the model's view entirely, so it never plans
 *  around them. Everything else the SDK ships runs — and `claude-turn.test.ts`
 *  holds a ledger of every tool the SDK's own generated schemas enumerate, so a
 *  name a future SDK adds fails a test instead of being admitted in silence. */
