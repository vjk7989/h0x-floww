/**
 * `machine: "local"` — build list item 7.
 *
 * The explicit opt-in that runs the Agent SDK on the host's own server: the
 * workspace materializes to a temp dir, and the SAME sync-back seam lands the
 * diff. Never the default — a spawned-CLI harness without a sandbox is a boot
 * error (design §9), and this is the escape hatch a host chooses on purpose.
 *
 * Tools reach the host's MCP door exactly as the box's do (10-mcp §3b), over a
 * real HTTP round trip to the deployment's own base URL. That is deliberate
 * sameness: `machine: "local"` is an opt-in about WHERE the SDK runs, and making
 * it a second tool transport is what turned it into a second implementation of
 * the same harness before.
 *
 * The SDK arrives by DYNAMIC import, bundler-ignored: it is an optional peer, so
 * neither `tsc`, nor a host's BUILD, nor a host who never opts in ever needs the
 * ~250MB platform binary on disk. This file is the only place on any host path
 * that names it.
 *
 * **What this mode does NOT have: a box.** The session runs its own tools
 * unprompted (`permissionMode: "bypassPermissions"`, claude-turn.ts) on the
 * stated grounds that "the box IS the permission — copies only, no
 * credentials, reality happens at commit". Here:
 *
 *   - "copies only" is FALSE. `cwd` is a directory the shell is POINTED at, not
 *     a boundary it is held inside; `Bash` runs as the host's own server process
 *     over the host's own filesystem and network, with no egress allowlist
 *     because there is no provider network layer to hang one on.
 *   - "no credentials" is TRUE OF THE ENVIRONMENT, and only that. Measured in
 *     the Agent SDK's own spawn (0.3.215: `xt ? {...xt} : {...process.env}`,
 *     with no merge-style `...process.env,` anywhere): passing `env` REPLACES
 *     the host environment rather than merging into it, so the subprocess sees
 *     our `inferenceEnv()` values and NOT the host server's other secrets.
 *     That is a real containment and worth knowing.
 *   - But it stops at the environment. Secrets AT REST are untouched by it: a
 *     `.env` file, `~/.aws/credentials`, a service-account JSON, a kubeconfig —
 *     anything the host OS user can read, `Bash` can read, because it IS that
 *     user. A scoped env does not make the disk unreadable.
 *
 * Everything driving that shell is end-user chat. So this mode grants what a
 * shell account on the deployment grants, and the operator is told so, once, on
 * the first turn ({@link warnLocalRiskOnce}). The sandbox path is the safe one,
 * and the default.
