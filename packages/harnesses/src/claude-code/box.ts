/**
 * The sandbox path — ONE box per conversation, holding ONE live session.
 *
 * **What this file used to be.** A machine POOL with an idle sweep that
 * SNAPSHOTTED before destroying, a resume-ref threaded through `turn.state`, and
 * a token-rotation handshake to re-authenticate a woken supervisor — about 200
 * lines of machinery whose entire purpose was to make a cold start per message
 * cheap. A live session has no cold start per message, so none of it is needed:
 * the box stays up for the conversation and is DESTROYED when it goes idle.
 * A conversation that outlives its box recovers the honest way — a fresh box,
 * files re-materialized from the store, the thread re-seeded from our transcript.
 *
 * That trade is deliberate and it is the cheaper one: a snapshot bought us a
 * resumable session id at the cost of a resume-ref, a rotation protocol, and two
 * race windows. Re-materializing from the store — which is the truth anyway —
 * costs one round trip on the rare message that finds its box gone.
 *
 * **The bridge is GONE.** `SandboxMachine.request()` used to be the only runtime
 * data path INTO the box, so the host drove: it posted a message, then polled;
 * when the model reached a projected tool the box parked the ask and handed it
 * out on the next poll; the host ran `turn.tools.call()` and posted the answer
 * back. cc-native MEASURED whether our MCP door could replace that and it could
 * not; door-ctx made it (10-mcp §3b), so the box now reaches the host's tools
 * directly over remote MCP with a credential scoped to the turn in flight.
 *
 * The poll loop stays — it is how text, usage and `wrote` events leave the box —
 * but it no longer carries asks, and there is no `/answer` route.
 *
 * **§1.4, and a cost the flip introduced.** A guarded call may block up to
 * `APPROVAL_WAIT_MS` for a human tap. That wait used to happen HERE, where the
 * host could arm the idle timer across it so a wait outliving the idle budget
 * lost the box. It now happens inside the door, on the host, and from out here
 * it is indistinguishable from a slow tool — so the box IS held for that window
 * (bounded by `MESSAGE_BUDGET_MS`). Better for the user (an approved call
 * resumes on the same session) and worse for cost (a parked write holds a
 * sandbox for up to 90s). Recorded in the lane's close note as a deviation.

 *
 * Two skin entries, because a session box needs exactly two things to function:

 *      (`VENDO_INFERENCE_URL` → `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) is allowed and
 *      `api.anthropic.com` is not.
 *   2. the DOOR origin — every host tool travels the host's MCP door now
 *      (10-mcp §3b), so this is what replaced "the box holds nothing and reaches
 *      nothing". Per DEPLOYMENT, so it arrives from composition's `toolDoor`
 *      rather than being written down here.
 *
 * Nothing else: no npm registry, no telemetry, no update endpoint. The SDK is
 * baked into the machine image, and the CLI's side traffic is switched off in
 * `inferenceEnv()`.
