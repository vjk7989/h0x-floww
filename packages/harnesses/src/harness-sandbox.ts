/**
 * How a boot-constructed harness reaches a COMPOSED adapter.
 *
 * `harness: claudeCode()` is written by the HOST, at boot, where no `createVendo`
 * composition exists yet — the same gap that made the documented `harness:
 * vendo()` opt-in think with a zero-character prompt (contract §1 amendment).
 * `Turn` is frozen and carries no adapter slot, and design §3's law is that
 * host-side dependencies "arrive by factory closure", so a harness that wants a
 * sandbox may simply be handed one: `claudeCode({ sandbox })`.
 *
 * This is the other half — for the host who wired `createVendo({ sandbox })` and
 * reasonably expects `requires: { sandbox: true }` to MEAN something. Composition
 * fills the slot once, keyed by the harness value itself, and the harness reads
 * it at turn time. Deployment-scoped, not per-turn: the adapter is a deployment
 * fact, so there is nothing here that could attribute one user's machine to
 * another user's thread.
 *
 * A `WeakMap` rather than an `AsyncLocalStorage` deliberately — ALS would have to
 * survive `createUIMessageStream`'s deferral of `execute`, and a slot that is
 * silently empty is exactly the failure mode this file exists to close.

 * host's, and the box is deliberately credential-free. Before door-ctx it
 * reached the registry through an inverted HTTP bridge the host polled; now it
 * reaches the SAME `turn.tools` over the host's own MCP door, using a credential
 * this port mints (10-mcp §3b).
 *
 * The credential states nothing and grants nothing on its own: it is a pointer
 * at "the turn currently in flight on thread T", mintable only from inside such
 * a turn, and dead the moment that turn ends.
