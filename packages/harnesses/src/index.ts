/**
 * `@vendoai/harnesses` — one central home for the thinkers, and the runtime that
 * runs any of them safely (build contract 2026-07-30 §1.6).
 *
 * The contract types themselves live in `@vendoai/core` so every block may speak
 * them; this package is the implementation half: `defineHarness`, the runtime,
 * and `vendo()` — the default in-process, key-free thinker.
 *
 * Wave 2 adds `claudeCode()`; external drivers arrive as subpaths with their SDKs
 * as optional peers (`@vendoai/harnesses/claude-code`).
 *
 * `instant()` was the third thinker and is GONE (blueprint §14.1, 2026-08-05).
 * Two engines and no third: the lean `vendo()` loop, and the builder on the
 * claude-code runtime. The specialist existed to reach a layout in seconds by
 * routing an app ask straight at the engine tool, and the paint seam now does that
 * for every harness — a plan file renders its skeleton the moment it parses,
 * whoever wrote it — so its whole reason for being was absorbed by the thing every
 * thinker already rides.
