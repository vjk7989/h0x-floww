/**
 * `vendo()` — the default harness. NOT a second loop: it drives `startTurn` from
 * ./loop.ts — the one loop this package has, shared with its hired subagents and
 * the screen agent — so every rail in it (the step cap, `buildFailedStop`, the
 * history window, the cache breakpoints, the step-limit notice) is shared rather
 * than re-derived.
 *
 * What the lift changes, and only this:
 * - tools execute through `turn.tools.call()`, which runs the SHIPPED guarded-call
 *   path — so the guard, the audit row, the view channel and the transcript mirror
 *   are not this file's business and cannot be forgotten;
 * - approvals are §1.4's wait-or-fail inside `call()`, so there is no
 *   `needsApproval` hook here and no second consent path;
 * - output is the closed `HarnessEvent` vocabulary instead of wire chunks, so this
 *   file contains no persistence and no wire code;
 * - it hires its own subagents for big jobs. Weight and staffing are the harness's
 *   business — that is the dividing line, and orchestration is thinking.
