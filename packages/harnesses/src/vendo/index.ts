/**
 * `@vendoai/harnesses/vendo` — the default in-process thinker and the turn loop
 * it drives.
 *
 * One folder per harness, one subpath per harness: this mirrors
 * `../claude-code/`, so a harness's driver, its loop, its tool-search strategy
 * and its provider ladder sit together and are imported together. The root
 * barrel still exports `vendo()` itself (the umbrella's `harness: vendo()`
 * one-liner); the knobs a host may reach live here.
 *
 * The loop itself (`startTurn` and its shapes) is deliberately NOT exported:
 * it was public for "external drivers" that never came — zero importers outside
 * this package's own tests, which reach it from source. A barrel export with no
 * reader is surface nobody asked for.
