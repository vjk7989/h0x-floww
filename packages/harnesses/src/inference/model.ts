 * `vendoModel(name?)` — the vendo model family entry (models spec 2026-07-22):
 * a lazily-resolving ai-SDK LanguageModel bound to the app's credential
 * ladder. It IS an ai-SDK LanguageModel (BYO seam unchanged, 03-agent §1),
 * resolving the credential lazily on first use:
 *
 * - env-key rungs delegate to the host-installed @ai-sdk provider (either live
 *   spec, v3 or v4) with full native tool calling — works in production too.
 *   Since the
 *   selection law they are reachable only through the internal
 *   VENDO_DEV_CREDENTIAL pin: a host's own provider key belongs in `models`,
 *   where it is a CHOICE (`models: { default: anthropic(key) }`), not in an env
 *   var Vendo sniffs.
 * - VENDO_API_KEY delegates to the Vendo Cloud model gateway: the
 *   host-installed @ai-sdk/anthropic pointed at `<console>/api/v1`, whose
 *   Anthropic-compatible /messages endpoint serves the metered allowance
 *   under the vendo model family names (`vendo` by default).
 * - nothing available → every call fails with the exact instructions.
 *
 * Name strings pass through VERBATIM to whatever the resolved credential
 * talks to — Cloud key → the gateway (vendo-* names are real model ids
 * there), provider key → that provider, untouched. There is NO client-side
 * name translation of any kind; an unknown name surfaces the provider's own
 * error. The only "magic" is per-rung/per-slot DEFAULTS when no name is
 * given, and per-slot env pins (precedence: explicit model object → env pin
 * → configured string → per-rung default).
