/**
 * Materialization + diff sync-back — build contract §3.5, verbatim law.
 *
 * A sandboxed harness gets a real disk, so the workspace has to leave the store
 * and come back. Checkout writes the caller's visible files out; sync-back is
 * **diff-based, per file, never wholesale** — only paths whose content hash
 * changed are committed. Each mount's `scratch/` never syncs. The hot path
 * (`app.tsx`) syncs MID-TURN, which is what puts the screen on screen;
 * everything else lands at turn end.
 *
 * **Permission is the workspace's, never this file's** (§9.3, design §8): every
 * question about who may write what is `workspace.canCommit(path)`, asked
 * per file at the two moments `can()` runs on the sandbox path — checkout, to
 * decide whether a file lands read-only on the disk, and sync-back, against live
 * rows, to decide whether a changed file goes home. A hardcoded path table
 * stood here through wave 3 and answered for `/orgs/**` mounts it had never
 * heard of, which made every team file invisible to `claudeCode()` and dropped
 * every edit to one with no error anywhere.
 *
 * This file is deliberately harness-agnostic and transport-agnostic: it moves
 * bytes between a `WorkspaceFs` and a plain path→bytes list. `claudeCode()` is
 * its caller today; any future harness is the same shape.
 *
 * Landing bytes and calling `commit()` is the WHOLE mid-turn render story — the
 * render seam (`@vendoai/apps` render-seam.ts) wraps `commit` and emits the
 * view, so this file never speaks about views.
