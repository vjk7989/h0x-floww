 *  When the thread's final message is an assistant turn, the ai-SDK CONTINUES
 *  it (handleUIMessageStreamFinish reuses its id and seeds the new turn's state
 *  from its parts), so a retry after a failed turn would append the real answer
 *  UNDER the stale "no model key" line and persist both — the flagship keyless
 *  → `vendo login` → Retry flow, permanently wrong on every reload. Anything
 *  the failed turn actually produced (partial text, tool beats) stays.
 *
 *  The emptied message is KEPT rather than dropped: persistence writes one row
 *  per changed message and can only add or replace, never remove. A message
 *  dropped here would simply stay in the store — the retry would look clean live
 *  and still reload with the stale notice above the answer. Left in place, the
 *  continuation reuses its id and the write overwrites the stored copy.
 *
 *  `stored` is the transcript as the STORE holds it, and it is what makes this
 *  work over the wire: the ai-SDK's `regenerate()` slices the assistant message
 *  it is replacing off the history it posts, so the retry arrives ending in the
 *  user message and the record to clear is not in it at all. Carrying the stored
 *  one back on is also what makes the retry a continuation — the SDK reuses that
 *  message's id, so the recovered answer overwrites the failed row instead of
 *  landing under it. Without it the reload showed both, forever. */
