 * spec §16 — the card shell's three laws, asserted through the REAL card
 * components (the audit's root finding was that no designed reference existed,
 * so nothing we gate on could see a card at all).
 *
 * 1. Ancestors size the shell, never undress it — every card kind renders ONE
 *    `.fl-cardshell` with the same head/line/actions vocabulary.
 * 2. ONE icon well (`.fl-card-ic`, 28px), ONE primary and ONE ceremony button.
 * 3. The plain-words line is mandatory: every kind renders `.fl-card-line`.
