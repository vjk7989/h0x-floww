// write (live fixture wire, and a client pointed at one that has since shut
// down), an `onPin`-only host, whose own mirror is the only confirmation there
// is, and a direct caller of the public `playPinCeremony` that confirms nothing.
// The mirror image matters just as much: a SLOW confirmation must still ring,
// which is its own case here.
