/**
 * Wave-1 live proof E2c — the consent card and the 100× misread.
 *
 * Asking Maple to "send $47.50 to Acme Utilities for the July water bill"
 * produced a CRITICAL card whose amount row read `4750`. Everything else on it
 * was right: the tool title, the real recipient, the memo, "Runs as you". The one
 * number that decides how much money leaves reads as $4,750.
 *
 * The unit is not guessable from the value — it is DECLARED, in the host's own
 * input schema (`z.number().describe("Amount in integer cents")`), and these
 * cases pin that the card reads that declaration, formats from it, and says so
 * plainly when there is no declaration to read.
