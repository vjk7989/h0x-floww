// Harness-path defect (live E2E) — a connector call that ends `connect-required`
// on a HARNESS turn (vendo() / claudeCode()) is mirrored as a bare
// `tool-output-denied` (harnesses/src/wire.ts), so the thread's only record of
// the ask is the bridge's `data-vendo-connect` part. Nothing consumed it, so an
// unconnected service produced a silent denial and the promised connect card
// never appeared. The ENGINE path carries the typed outcome on the tool part AND
// writes the same part, so both shapes must add up to exactly one card.
