// RISK RE-CHECK — what a REFUSED report does to the rest of the session.
//
// The caps that just landed on POST /slots (packages/vendo/src/wire/slots.ts —
// at most 200 entries, each id and label 1-256 characters) turned a 400 on this
// route from something a host page could not realistically provoke into
// something one prop can: a label longer than 256 characters, on any slot. The
// route validates the array all-or-nothing (`reported.map(descriptor)`), so
// that one entry refuses the WHOLE batch — and a page reports every one of its
// slots in a single batch by design (use-placements.ts).
//
// Nothing is stubbed — the slots write through the real client to the real wire
// fixture, whose /slots route mirrors the real caps, and the assertions read
// that server's own state back.
