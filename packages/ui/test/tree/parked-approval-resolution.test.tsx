 * A press the guard parked, from the stall to the repaint.
 *
 * The screen, the engine and the Kit controls are the real ones
 * (screen-bridge.test.tsx documents why nothing here is stubbed on the render
 * side). Two doubles, both of them the OTHER side of a seam by definition: the
 * host's `onAction`, and the wire. What the server actually writes into an
 * `ApprovalResolution` is held by
 * `packages/vendo/tests/parked-action-resolution.e2e.test.ts`, where the apps
 * runtime's write path and the umbrella's read path both run for real — so the
 * shape below cannot quietly drift away from the one that ships.
 *
 * The stall this closes: `pending-approval` is the honest answer at press time,
 * so the node painted "waiting for approval" and the screen sat on it forever —
 * including long after the server had resumed the call and changed the data.
