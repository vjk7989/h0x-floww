/** 08-ui §4–5 — real-browser harness backed by the exact in-test wire route table.
 *
 * Served PRODUCTION-BUILT by default (`vite build` + `vite preview`). Vite's dev
 * server hands the app `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`, which turns on
 * every `developmentMode()` rail in the chrome — the dev-only detail lines that
 * §16 forbids a person from ever reading. A browser suite that only ever ran on
 * the dev server was therefore asserting, and photographing, copy that ships to
 * nobody: `verification-eng229.spec.ts` pinned a raw driver sentence that a real
 * user never sees. `VENDO_HARNESS_DEV=1` puts the dev server back for debugging.
