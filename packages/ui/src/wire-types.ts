/**
 * Structural declarations of wire-response shapes owned by sibling block
 * contracts (07-automations, 03-agent, 09-vendo §3).
 *
 * ui depends on core only (00-overview dependency rule), so shapes that the
 * wire returns but core does not export are declared here, verbatim from the
 * frozen contract text. "Cannot drift because both sides copied the same frozen
 * text" turned out to be a promise rather than a mechanism, so the shapes the
 * producer and this consumer BOTH speak are no longer restated here: they are
 * re-exported below from `core/src/app-surfaces.ts` and from the
 * app-generation contract door, `@vendoai/apps/contract`. The client's public
 * surface is unchanged, and this file no longer carries a second copy.
 *
 * That removes ui's copy; it does not by itself make one definition. The app
 * engine's server door still declares its own richer `EditResult`, so the name
 * has two declarations inside `@vendoai/apps` — see the note in
 * `apps/src/contract/wire-types.ts`.
