/**
 * ONE pending-approvals poller per client.
 *
 * Every surface that shows the attention count reads the same asks: the
 * launcher badge, the center's "Needs you" rail, the toast feed. Each of those used to hold its OWN `useResource`, so a host mounting
 * both the overlay and the center ran three or four independent `GET /approvals`
 * intervals forever — 36 requests a minute with nothing waiting.
 *
 * This is the same shape as the run-activity store: a module singleton per
 * client, N subscribers, one request. The cadence is the FASTEST any subscriber
 * asked for (a surface that wants 5s still gets 5s), polling pauses while the
 * document is hidden, and the last unsubscribe stops it entirely.
