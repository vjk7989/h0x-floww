/**
 * ONE placement poller per client, shared by every mounted slot.
 *
 * Slot discovery used to be per-slot: each `VendoSlot` listed EVERY app the
 * person owned, every 5s, and scanned the documents for its own name. Three
 * slots on a page meant three full app lists a tick. This inverts it — slots
 * register their id, the poller asks for all of them in one
 * `GET /apps/placements?slots=…`, and every listener is woken with the answer.
 *
 * Module scope keyed by the client (like the overlay/palette registries): the
 * slots sharing a poller share no React tree, and the client IS the identity
 * of a deployment's wire. Nothing polls until a slot registers, and the loop
 * stops with the last one — SSR renders start nothing.
 *
 * The same per-client scope carries the OUTBOUND half (`report`): a page of
 * slots telling the registry they exist, deduped and batched into one write.
