/**
 * The aggregates in code-land — the handful of reductions an island reaches for
 * by name, over core's ONE numeric reduce ({@link reduceNumeric}).
 *
 * They no longer build expression SOURCE and hand it to an evaluator. They
 * used to, because `$expr` was a closed dialect with its own `sum` and the rule
 * was that this repo may hold only one. A `{...}` gap is JavaScript now, so
 * `sum(rows, "amount_cents")` here and
 * `rows.reduce((t, r) => t + r.amount_cents, 0)` in a screen are the same
 * language reaching the same arithmetic — there is no second implementation to
 * avoid, only a second copy of the REDUCE, and that still lives in core.
 *
 * One posture, as everywhere in this package: the number (or the points), or
 * `undefined` — loading and a mismatch both. An island renders a placeholder,
 * never a throw.

 * amount column erased the total the other 499 rows agreed on, and a host that
 * writes `null` for some rows and omits the key in others is the ordinary case,
 * not a broken one. An explicit null was already skipped for that reason.
 *
 * What the skip must not do is turn a MISLABELLED field into a number:
 * `reduceNumeric("sum", [])` is 0, so skipping every row would make
 * `sum(rows, "nope")` answer 0 — a wrong number that reads as real. Hence the
 * second half: a column where rows were rejected and NOT ONE yielded a number
 * is still `undefined`. An empty row list, and a column that is all nulls, keep
 * answering 0, because there the emptiness is the data itself and a screen
 * writing the same reduce by hand gets 0 too.
