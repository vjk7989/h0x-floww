/**
 * Link — the host's OWN pages, by name. `to` names a route the host registered;
 * the press is handed to the host's `onNavigate`, so the host's own router does
 * the moving and keeps its transitions.
 *
 * A target the registry does not carry renders as visibly inert text — muted,
 * with no link affordance. That is the whole security posture: generated output
 * SELECTS among the host's routes, it never authors a URL, so there is no offsite
 * or `javascript:` target for it to emit — and a param it does fill is
 * URL-encoded before it reaches the path.
 *
 * NO `href`, deliberately. A registered path is written the way the host's
 * router takes it, which is not the way the browser does: Maple is mounted at
 * `/maple`, so `router.push("/accounts")` lands correctly while an `href` of the
 * same string 404s. Only the host can spell the URL, so this renders the link
 * SEMANTICS (role, focus, Enter) and leaves the address to the host.
