/**
 * The reshape vocabulary in code-land (blueprint §5.4).
 *
 * Nine one-liners over core's PUBLIC {@link applyReshape} — one per LIVE op.
 * The two deprecated ops (`asOptions`, `template`) are deliberately absent:
 * the Kit's own props replace them, and wrapping them here would teach a
 * dialect that is being retired.
 *
 * ONE POSTURE, everywhere in this package: you get the value, or `undefined`.
 * `undefined` in stays `undefined` out (loading is never a mismatch), and a
 * type mismatch degrades to `undefined` too — a code-land app must render a
 * placeholder, never throw. When an app wants the REASON, it calls the
 * re-exported `applyReshape` directly and reads `result.reason`; there is no
 * second result type in this package.
