/**
 * What happens to a press the guard parked.

 * `pending-approval` is the honest answer at press time — nothing has changed
 * yet — so the node paints "waiting for approval" and the screen stops there.
 * Nothing ever cleared it. The decision lands on a different surface entirely
 * (the approvals queue, another tab, the host's own card), the server resumes
 * the exact parked call from `guard.onApprovalDecision`, and the screen that
 * pressed the button was never told: it sat on "Sending…" forever, over data
 * the backend had already changed.
 *
 * This watches every outstanding parked press for its terminal state. The
 * same-tab `vendo:approvals-decided` announcement settles it the moment the
 * decision lands; a slow poll covers every decision this page cannot hear.
