/**
 * The interactive bridge: one live screen behind the tree the renderer paints.
 *
 * A component screen ships BOTH halves — the flat tree of its first paint, and
 * the compiled source that can produce the next one. The served tree paints
 * immediately and the VM boots behind it, so an interactive screen is never
 * slower to appear than a static one; the moment the VM is up, a `{$handler}`
 * callback moves the screen:
 *
 *     fire(handlerId, event) → { tree, intents }
 *       tree    → flattenTree → swapped in through the SAME walk the payload
 *                 took (validation, bindings, `$state`, outcomes all unchanged)
 *       intents → each one through the renderer's existing `onAction` pipe, so
 *                 the guard, approvals and per-node outcome notices are the ones
 *                 already there — then `settle(intentId, outcome)` for whatever
 *                 the answer changes.
 *
 * A tool call that SUCCEEDED also makes the screen's own data stale — the
 * cancelled transfer is still in the list it was painted from — so the served
 * `queryPlan` re-runs down the same pipe and the answers are SUPPLIED to the
 * screen that is already standing. That is the whole refresh story: no generated
 * handler hand-patches a list it did not fetch, and nothing the person typed is
 * lost, because a supply re-renders the same component rather than booting a new
 * one.
 *
 * The same door answers the other half of a read. A `useQuery` whose input the
 * screen COMPUTES cannot be resolved before the screen renders, so the paint
 * NAMES what it wanted (`misses()`) and this file answers it — boot, ask, read,
 * supply, ask again, bounded at {@link MAX_SUPPLY_ROUNDS}.
 *
 * Four rules the shape encodes:
 *
 *  1. The screen never disappears. A VM that will not boot, a handler that
 *     throws, a budget that runs out — the last good tree stays on screen and the
 *     failure lands in the per-node outcome slot of the node that fired.
 *  2. One intent per handler at a time. Rapid-fire is the hole this closes: the
 *     second click on a cancel button is dropped HERE, not merely greyed out in
 *     the render that may not have happened yet.
 *  3. One refresh at a time. A second mutation that settles mid-refetch queues
 *     ONE more cycle rather than racing a second set of reads against the first.
 *  4. The VM boots ONCE per screen — never again. The identity is the compiled source string,
 *     not the payload object, because callers legitimately rebuild the payload
 *     object every render — an object dep would re-boot the screen (and discard
 *     everything the user typed) on every parent re-render.
