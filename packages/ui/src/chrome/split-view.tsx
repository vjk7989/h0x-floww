/** 2026-07 demo feedback — the expandable split-view workspace.
 *
 * The centered overlay modal is a fine conversation surface but a cramped one
 * for microapps: the generated view competes with the transcript inside one
 * ~620px column. Expanding animates the modal into a near-fullscreen
 * workspace — the conversation docks as a left-hand rail (~1/3, min 360px)
 * with the composer at its bottom while the FEATURED microapp renders large
 * in a right stage (~2/3 width). Collapse animates back; the
 * conversation NEVER remounts across the flip (same rule as close/reopen —
 * the DOM hierarchy around the thread is identical in both states, only CSS
 * changes).
 *
 * This module is the state machine (pure, unit-tested) plus the context the
 * thread's app cards use to register embeds and feature themselves. The
 * VendoOverlay owns the reducer instance and the layout/animation shell.
