/**
 * The remixable-surface affordance: the host marking one of its own components
 * as remixable. The ✦ is ONE DOOR — it opens the conversation the page already
 * has, about this component, and the person types their wish there. It used to
 * open a wish form of its own, which was a second place to ask the same
 * question: the chat could answer, show its work, and say when a remix failed;
 * the form could only mint and go quiet.
 *
 * The remix that conversation makes mounts IN PLACE, replacing the wrapped
 * child at this boundary for that user only. Until its screen is ready the
 * host's own live original stays on the page.
 *
 * At rest a 9px muted ✦ seed sits inside the wrapped element's top-right
 * corner — visible if you look for it, invisible while you are working.
 * Pointing at the element blooms that seed IN PLACE into the ✦ pill — same
 * corner, same optical centre — so it reads as one mark opening rather than a
 * glyph swapping for a button. On an unremixed surface the pill IS the door;
 * on a remixed one it is the pin chrome (pin-chrome.tsx), because a remix is a
 * pinned app and one ✦ menu is the whole point.
 *
 * REVEALED IS STATE, NOT `:hover`. A CSS-only reveal dies the instant the
 * cursor leaves the box, which is exactly what it does on the way to the pill
 * — so the pill could never be clicked. One boolean instead, and pointer-leave
 * only clears it after a grace period the next pointer-enter cancels. Focus
 * reveals it the same way (focus and blur bubble on this div), so it stays
 * keyboard-reachable.
