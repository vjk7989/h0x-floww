/** spec §16 — ONE card shell, three laws.
 *
 *  Every consent/status card in the product is this shell with different
 *  CONTENTS: eyebrow · one-size icon well · title · the mandatory plain-words
 *  line · field rows or a list · actions · byline. Standing-access and the
 *  resolved record are contents only, and every surface that shows one (thread,
 *  waiting strip, activities, mobile sheet, voice, embeds) renders the SAME
 *  shell.
 *
 *  The SENTENCE family — the approval ask (M1), the connect row (C2) and the
 *  automation rule (A1) — is headless: its first line IS the card (a question,
 *  a toolkit name, a rule), with one quiet line under it carrying the rest.
 *  Those three wear no eyebrow and no icon well (connect shows the toolkit's
 *  raw mark, deliberately not a well: the well cropped the Gmail M). They are
 *  still this shell, and law 3 lives across each pair of lines.
 *
 *  1. Ancestors may set width/max-width on `.fl-cardshell` — never undress it.
 *  2. ONE icon well (28px), ONE primary button (`.fl-btn-primary`), ONE
 *     ceremony button (`.fl-btn-ceremony`). No card wears the ceremony register
 *     today: the approval ask carries irreversibility in plain words instead.
 *  3. The plain-words line is mandatory: a card always says what it DOES.
 *
 *  Geometry lives in the `.fl-card-*` CSS. Some elements also
 *  carry their legacy `.fl-approval*` / `.fl-grant` class: three suites, the
 *  corpus harness and the thread's morph start-rect lookup select on those
 *  names. They are markers only — the `.fl-card-*` rules are declared later in
 *  the one stylesheet, so the shell's geometry always wins.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT re-exported from `chrome/index.ts`: the shell is internal
 *  vocabulary (the export-surface test pins the public list), so surfaces
 *  import this module directly.
