 * everywhere): `<ApprovalCard>` itself, with the ask handed to it in words
 * because this is the one surface with no `ApprovalRequest` to derive them from.
 * The wire carries the rendered ask and nothing else, so the request below is
 * the shared §16 builder's honest minimum — no call, no schema, no grade.
 *
 * No `remember`: a grant is a standing yes to a call the person chose to make,
 * and nothing on this page is theirs to re-run. No venue byline either — the
 * wire carries no ctx, and printing one would be a guess.
 *
 * An ask that is no longer waiting — already answered on another surface, or
 * expired — settles into the same receipt a decision leaves, rather than
 * leaving buttons up that cannot work.
