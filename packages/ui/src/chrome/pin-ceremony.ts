/**
 * The pin payoff: a ghost of the card being pinned glides into the slot it
 * lands in, and the slot takes one settle pulse.
 *
 * A pin used to be silent — the panel stayed open over the page, and the slot
 * showed the app whenever its next poll happened to fire (up to five seconds
 * later). Nothing connected the click to the result. This is that connection,
 * and it is presentation only: the real pin is the host's `onPin` write plus
 * the slot's own read, so a missing destination means no animation rather than
 * a stranded ghost.
 *
 * THE PANEL IS GONE BEFORE ANYTHING MOVES. A pin's whole point is what appears
 * on the page, and the card being pinned sits in a centred panel over a scrim —
 * so the flight would otherwise play behind the very thing hiding it. The order
 * is: lift the ghost off the panel, dismiss the panel, then measure and fly over
 * the bare page.
 *
 * Plain DOM + Web Animations API on purpose: every element and keyframe here is
 * created per call and removed when it finishes, so nothing lands in the chrome
 * stylesheet. Fixed durations, no randomness — the same 480ms every run.
 *
 * Lifted from the Keystone demo's `pin-flight.ts`, which is where the sequence
 * was designed and proven on stage.
