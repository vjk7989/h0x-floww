 * The ONE ✦ menu — Edit in chat · Update · Revert — over any app the page is
 * showing on the person's behalf: one someone pinned into a host slot, and one
 * a `<Remixable>` component was remixed into (remixable.tsx mounts this same
 * chrome rather than a lookalike of it, so there is one ✦ vocabulary on the
 * page instead of two that almost match).
 *
 * Only `Revert` differs by owner, so only `Revert` is injected: a pinned app's
 * placement is unplaced, a remix's whole app is deleted. Both mean the same
 * thing to the person — the host's own markup comes back.
 *
 * REVEALED IS STATE, NOT `:hover`, for the reason Remixable documents: a
 * CSS-only reveal dies on the way to the pill, so the pill could never be
 * clicked. Touch has no hover at all, so a tap on the app reveals the seed and
 * a tap anywhere else puts it away.
 *
 * `useMenuDismiss` is scoped TWICE here, which is the whole of the touch
 * behavior: the popover closes on a press outside the popover, and the mark
 * only goes away on a press outside the APP, so tapping the app cannot undo the
 * tap that revealed it.
