/** ENG-225 — the connect dock: the in-bar connect-tools entry (.fl-dock) and

    the observed-connect bloom on success.

 * Open the sign-in window for a connect, SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the click.
 *
 * Safari and Firefox judge a popup by call-stack provenance, not by intent: a
 * `window.open` that runs after an `await` is no longer "during a click" and is
 * refused outright. The old flow awaited `initiate()` first so it could open the
 * window with the real URL in hand — which is precisely the shape those browsers
 * block. So the window opens BLANK on the click and is navigated once the
 * redirect URL arrives (see {@link completeConnection}).
 *
 * `noopener` is deliberately absent: it forces `window.open` to return null, and
 * the handle is what lets us navigate the window and close it from here when the
 * account goes active. The page we send it to is the broker's own consent page.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the browser blocked it anyway — the caller keeps going and
 * offers the same URL as a plain link.
 *
 * @param key Identifies THIS connect, and must be the same key the caller keys
 * its own per-row connect state by. It becomes the window's name, and a name is
 * what makes `window.open` return a window that is ALREADY OPEN: every connect
 * surface here permits concurrent connects, so one shared name meant the second
 * connect inherited the first's window, replaced a sign-in page still in flight,
 * and had it closed underneath by whichever connect settled first.
