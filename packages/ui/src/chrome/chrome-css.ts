/* ===== BEGIN S3 wet paint (lane L3) ========================================
   Every node of a STILL-STREAMING payload carries data-vendo-wet="1"
   (tree/renderer.tsx), and wet ink reads unfinished: dim and slightly
   desaturated. Assembly is the case this exists for — a partial tree's nodes
   resolve to real components long before their props arrive, so keying the dim
   on "the component has not resolved" left the half-built app painting at full
   strength, reading finished-but-blank instead of in-progress.

   Drying is the removal of the attribute. The node shell survives the swap from
   silhouette to real component, so the region transitions to full ink in place
   instead of popping, and the last node drying is the finish the hairline marks.

   The nested reset is load-bearing, not tidiness: opacity MULTIPLIES down the
   tree, so without it a node four deep would paint at .55^4 and vanish. Only the
   outermost wet box dims, which is also what makes a forming region read as one
   wash rather than a gradient.

   The transition IS the whole effect: no keyframes, no stagger, no loop. §8's
   one-animation law still holds, because a discrete 200ms state change is not a
   thing that moves while the build runs — the boot hairline stays the only one.

   Reduced motion keeps the dim and drops the transition, so the unfinished state
   still reads statically: the media query below gates only the transition, and the
   [data-vendo-motion="reduced"] root kill-switch never touches opacity or filter. */

   iframe app would pulse on arrival — served apps keep their beat bar untouched.
