/**
 * What an UNATTENDED run owes its caller, proved against merged main by an
 * independent prove-walk: the budget bounds the run even when every call parks,
 * the brief carries the user the caller named, an aborted run does nothing at
 * all, and a guard that fails while parking is reported as a failure rather than
 * as "waiting on a person". Real embedded store, real guard, real runtime; only
 * the thinker is scripted (CLAUDE.md: test the SEAM).
