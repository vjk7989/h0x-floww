/**
 * `agent.on(...)` — automations authored in code.
 *
 * A DECLARATION, never a write: the call validates and stashes, and a lifecycle
 * is what reaches the store. A trigger is INERT until `serve({ agents })` — or
 * `createVendo`'s boot, which runs this same reconcile — so a process that
 * declares and starts neither has no automations, by design and without a word
 * about it.
 *
 * Consent for a code-authored automation IS the code, so a redeploy reconciles:
 * new → created, edited → a new identity with the old one disarmed, deleted from
 * the source → disarmed (never deleted, so its run history survives).
