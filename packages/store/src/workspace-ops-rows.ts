/**
 * The workspace pair over the 42-op contract instead of this store's own
 * Postgres — what makes a hosted store (a key, no database) serve the same
 * `WorkspaceStoreFs` a local one does, byte for byte. The façade above
 * (workspace.ts) is unchanged, and so are its permission checks: `can()` reads
 * through the records door, which the hosted store already serves.
 *
 * Two shapes differ from the SQL backend and both are deliberate:
 *   - **Content is JSON on the wire**, so text files ride as a JSON string and
 *     anything that is not valid UTF-8 rides the {@link WORKSPACE_BYTES_KEY}
 *     base64 envelope. Encoding a PNG as a lossy string was the alternative.
 *   - **Revisions come from the caller.** The wire's commit answers `ok`, not a
 *     new revision, so `land` reports the checked-out revision plus one — which
 *     is exactly what the server assigns, and where it is not (a racing writer
 *     on a `/user` mount) the next turn's index reads the truth. Strict mounts
 *     never guess: their commit carries `expectedRevision`, and a lost swap
 *     comes back `conflict`.
