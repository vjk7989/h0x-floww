 *
 *  Two statements, both set-based, and the CALLER runs them in one transaction:
 *  1. create-or-touch the thread row, guarded on the subject exactly as
 *     putThreadRow's upsert is — an empty RETURNING means a foreign row holds
 *     the id, and the whole append is refused before a message row exists;
 *  2. one multi-row insert for the messages.
 *  Statement 1 leaves the thread row write-locked for the rest of the
 *  transaction, so statement 2 needs neither the ownership join nor the
 *  `FOR KEY SHARE OF t` its single-row sibling carries: a concurrent
 *  `deleteThread` cascade cannot slip between them and leave orphan rows.
 *
 *  `seq` is assigned HERE, by statement 2, and never by the caller — the fix
 *  for a real race (proven on PostgreSQL 17: 40 concurrent appends, 21 distinct
 *  seqs). `seq` carries conversation order and has no unique constraint, so two
 *  turns landing on the same number make the transcript fall back to ordering
 *  by message id, which is not turn order. Any `max(seq) + 1` read taken BEFORE
 *  the thread row is held is read by both racers under READ COMMITTED and hands
 *  them the same answer. Statement 1 above is what serialises them: the loser
 *  blocks there (on the row lock, or on the primary key when both are creating
 *  the thread) until the winner COMMITs, so statement 2's subquery — a new
 *  snapshot in READ COMMITTED — already sees the winner's rows.
 *
 *  `seq` is NOT updated on conflict. An append names where NEW messages go; a
 *  message the thread already holds has a decided position, and moving it would
 *  reorder the conversation the next turn reads. New rows land after the tail in
 *  batch order, which is the only rule the wire half can honor anyway — a wire
 *  body carries no seq — so both halves of `upsertMany` share this exactly. */
