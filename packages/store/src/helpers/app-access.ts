 * Build contract §9.3 — `can()`, one function, three doors (the workspace

 *
 * It is OSS and NEVER key-conditional: with no Cloud key no grant row can be
 * written, so it simply degenerates to "is it yours?" (§9.6). Memberships come
 * from the ctx ONLY — the host asserted them this request and `can()` never
 * queries an org chart, because Vendo does not have one (§9.1).
 *
 * Every row is read and written through the `engine` family, never raw SQL:
 * multi-party deployments are exactly the ones running on a hosted store, which
 * has no local db handle. `vendo_apps` and `vendo_app_grants` are Vendo's OWN
 * drawers, so they are named to the family that knows that (the allowlist gate
 * in front, the same routed doors behind) rather than to the generic
 * `records.*` door a host reaches its own rows through.
 *
 * The store's own `ops` when it carries one — the hosted store does, and its
 * client is one hop shorter than its `records` façade, which is built on these
 * very ops. Otherwise the family over the adapter's record doors
 * (`engineOverAdapter`), which is what a store this package minted and every
 * host's BYO adapter gets. No `ops` parameter: unlike guard or mcp, this helper
 * lives INSIDE @vendoai/store and takes the store itself, whose `ops` slot
 * (store.ts:17-22) already IS the surface a composition would have threaded.
