 * The one selector every store-shaped helper resolves itself through.

 * A helper like `threadMessageStore` used to open with `dbFor(store)` and throw
 * "Unknown VendoStore handle" for anything this package did not mint — which is
 * every hosted deployment, and is why a key-only host could not serve a harness
 * turn. The rows exist either way; only the road to them differs. So: the SQL
 * handle when there is one, the store's own 42-op surface when there is not, and
 * a named refusal only when the store offers neither.
 *
 * SQL wins when both are present. It is the same database, one hop shorter.
 *
 * `what` names the thing being served, so the refusal reads as a fact about the
 * deployment rather than an internals leak.
