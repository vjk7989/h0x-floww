/** The collections a sweep will not touch, because their rows are not the
 *  whole of what they own and lifting the row alone would leave the rest
 *  stranded in the live database with nothing left pointing at it:
 *
 *   · `vendo_threads` — the transcript lives in `vendo_thread_messages`, and the
 *     row itself carries the conversation's harness state in its `harness_state`
 *     column (`deleteThread` is a two-table cascade, ops.ts).
 *   · `vendo_apps` — an app row owns an entire drawer (its records, blobs,
 *     state and grants), and `createRecordStore`'s app gate refuses writes the
 *     moment the row is gone, so a lifted app leaves rows nothing can read,
 *     write, or erase.
 *   · `vendo_automations` — a run row names only its automation, so the erase
 *     cascade reaches runs by joining to this table (erase.ts). Lifting an
 *     automation row breaks that join and its runs survive their owner's
 *     erasure — the very thing a sweep must never become.
 *
 *  Refused rather than half-swept: a quarantine's whole promise is that what it
 *  lifted is still whole. Ageing any of these out is `lifecycle.erase`'s job
 *  (or `transcripts.deleteThread`'s), and both say so. */

 *  the door, a live conversation's harness continuity underneath it — and both
 *  are gone (harness state is a column on `vendo_threads`, which is refused for

 *
 *  Table names are interpolated into SQL, so they come only from the frozen
 *  routing constants (footprint.ts' rule), never from the caller's string. A

 *  collection with a table of its own is the whole table. The age column is the
 *  routing table's own `RESERVED_CURSOR_COLUMNS`, read rather than copied, so
 *  "older than" cannot come to mean one thing to a reader and another to a

 * destroys what was lifted before its own cutoff. The gap between them is the
 * feature: a window that turns out to be wrong is recoverable right up until
 * the purge, which is the whole difference between this and a DELETE.
 *
 * The lift is ONE statement — a data-modifying CTE — so a row is never in both
 * places and never in neither, without a transaction to hold open across
 * however many million rows a first sweep moves.
 *
 * The lifted row is stored VERBATIM (`to_jsonb` of the live row, whatever its
 * table's shape), not as the door's `VendoRecord` projection: the projection is
 * lossy for several tables, and a quarantine that cannot put back exactly what
 * it took is a delete with a longer name.
