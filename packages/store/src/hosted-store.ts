      on the replay is how a write lands twice.

      A typed mount answers the first write to a table it has not been told
      about with the DDL that would make the write legal, so the client confirms
      it and sends the write again. One write can need more than one round —
      create_table, then add_column for the fields the new table has no columns
      for — so this loops, and it is capped: a mount that keeps proposing is
      broken, and the caller has to hear that rather than watch a write spin.
      The handshake lives at THIS call, the one place a mutation is issued, so
      every writer — agents, automations, an interactive session — heals the
