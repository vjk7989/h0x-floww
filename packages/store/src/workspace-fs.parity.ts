 * Compile-time proof that core's vendored filesystem interface still matches the

 * `WorkspaceFs` extends an `IFileSystem` that core vendors verbatim (Apache-2.0)
 * so the SDK does not ship a bash interpreter for a type. Vendoring means the
 * copy can drift from upstream, and the failure mode is nasty: the workspace
 * would stop being accepted by `new Bash({ fs })` — the whole point of §3.2 —
 * and nothing else in the tree would notice. `pnpm typecheck` notices, here.
 *
 * just-bash is a devDependency (the bash tests), which is exactly right: this
 * assertion runs at build time in this repo and the import is type-only, so it
 * leaves no trace in the published surface.
