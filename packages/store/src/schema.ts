/** 02-store §4. v3 (block-actions design §C, ENG-263) historically added the
    Vendo-owned org tables (`vendo_orgs` + `vendo_org_members`); those tables
    are cut under the simplify-v2 kill-list (§A5) — orgs live on the Vendo-hosted side
    now. Existing dev databases that already have `vendo_orgs`/
    `vendo_org_members` keep those orphaned tables — erasing them is not
    required and this migration does not attempt it.

    v4 (kill-list §B3) added `vendo_sessions`, the guest-session registry. Guest
    sessions are gone; the table's CREATE is removed here and ADDITIVE_DDL now
    drops the orphan left behind on databases that already had it.

    v5 (ENG-356, knowledge design v2 (2026-07-22) R1) adds the dedicated
    knowledge record collections `vendo_knowledge_docs` / `vendo_knowledge_chunks`.
    Bumping the version is load-bearing, not cosmetic (review fix F1): the DDL
    loop runs only while `version < SCHEMA_VERSION`, so appending the tables
    WITHOUT this bump would leave every existing v4 database on 4 forever and the
    new tables would never be created.

    v6 (the embedded-agent build contract) is ONE bump carrying all four new
    tables — wave-1 lanes B and D landed together, so a database moves to v6
    once and gets the whole set:
      · `vendo_workspace_files` / `vendo_workspace_history` (§3.3) — the agent's
        filesystem as a façade over rows (documents are files, records stay
        tables), with a revision and an append-only history trail per path.
      · `vendo_thread_messages` (§6) — one row per transcript message, so a turn
        writes O(messages) instead of rewriting the whole array. `vendo_threads`
        LOSES `messages`; the v6 backfill splits every existing array into rows
        before dropping the column.
      · `vendo_effects` (§7) — the effect ledger that makes fail-and-re-run
        correct, keyed per (run, turn, tool, input, ordinal) and subject-scoped
        so it joins the erase cascade.
    Same load-bearing bump as v5 — the DDL loop only runs while
    version < SCHEMA_VERSION.

    v7 (build contract §9.2, wave 3) adds `vendo_app_grants`: app → principal →
    level, the ONLY multi-party rows Vendo stores. Memberships are asserted per
    request by the host's own identity system and are never persisted (§9.1),
    so this one table is the whole sharing model. Same load-bearing bump.

    v8 adds `vendo_idempotency_ledger` (01 §12 `IdempotencyLedger`): what a keyed
    request already answered, so a replayed `Idempotency-Key` gives that answer
    back instead of applying the mutation a second time. It is a table in THIS
    database rather than a store of its own because the ledger must commit with
    the mutation it gates — one that lives elsewhere can commit while its
    mutation rolls back, and the replay then confidently returns a result for
    work that never happened. Same load-bearing bump.

    v9 adds `vendo_quarantine` (01 §12 `StoreOps.retention`): where a retention
    sweep puts the rows it lifts out of a live collection, so the window between
    `quarantine` and `purge` is recoverable instead of a delete with a nicer
    name. The engine OWNS this table — no caller names it, no collection maps to
    it, and `purge` is the only way back out. It is a table of its own rather
    than a column on every collection because the rows come from thirty-odd
    tables with nothing in common but their id, and a `quarantined_at` column
    apiece would mean every read in the store growing a `WHERE quarantined_at IS
    NULL` it can never be trusted to remember. Same load-bearing bump.

    v10 adds `vendo_usage` (01 §12 `StoreOps.usage`): the meter a host's
    `LimitsCallback` decides on. One row per metered action, keeping its own
    instant — never a pre-bucketed count, because a policy authors its own
    window ("20 messages an hour", "3 generations today") and a bucket can only
    answer the periods whoever chose it happened to pick. It is engine-owned
    like `vendo_quarantine`: no collection maps to it and no door lists it, so a
    meter row is only ever counted. Same load-bearing bump.

    v11 makes the AUTOMATION the first-class record and takes the app's place in
    the two tables that assumed one. `vendo_automations` is the new drawer: one
    principal-owned record per row, `subject` (the owner) the erase-cascade
    selector — a row carries a live webhook signing key, so a record that
    outlived its owner's erasure would be a hole, not an untidiness — and
    `revision` the optimistic-concurrency counter the row's atomic verbs turn.
    No caller claims a fire through it: the tick arbitrates on the schedule
    cursor instead (packages/automations/src/ingestion-surface.ts).
    `vendo_runs` re-keys `app_id`
    to `automation_id`, because a run belongs to the record that fired it and an
    automation holds no app reference at all; `vendo_grants` re-keys `trigger_id`
    to `automation_id` for the same reason — the trigger it named lived inside an
    app document that no longer has triggers. Stored run rows are DROPPED rather
    than migrated: an app-keyed run cannot be read by the new path and no
    selector reaches it, so ADDITIVE_DDL empties the table ONCE, guarded on the
    old column's existence. Same load-bearing bump as v5 — the DDL loop only runs
    while version < SCHEMA_VERSION, so without it no existing database would ever
    create the new table.

    v12 moves harness continuity onto the thread row and DELETES `vendo_state`.
    The bookmark a session-owning harness resumes on (its native-session ref) rode
    `vendo_state` under a synthetic `app_id` of `harness_state:<threadId>`, which
    bought "no new table" at the price of a slot that no table cascade covered:
    thread deletion swept it by hand in two places (ops.ts, helpers/threads.ts), a
    retention sweep needed a fence to keep the app-state door from seeing it, and
    the erase cascade reached it only through a second selector. It is one
    nullable `harness_state jsonb` column on `vendo_threads` now — ONE slot per
    thread, on the row that already carries the thread's owner — so every one of
    those hand-wired cascades is simply the row going away.

    `vendo_state`'s OTHER tenant, an app's per-user state, is dropped rather than
    migrated: an app's own data lives in the app's own SQL database, so nothing
    has written this table in a long time and the table's only live rows were the
    harness slots the backfill below relocates.
    The v2 backfill goes with it — it relocated legacy rows INTO this table, and
    there is no longer anywhere to put them. Any legacy `vendo_records` row under
    collection `vendo_state` simply stays where it is, unread, rather than being
    moved into a table that is about to be dropped. */

// `seq` comes from WITH ORDINALITY (1-based) shifted to 0-based, so the stored

// It never loses a message, and that takes real work rather than a comment. Two

//   1. a legacy array simply repeats an `id` (the client minted it, so nothing

//   2. a message with NO id derives `msg_<index>`, which can equal a real
//      message's literal id (`msg_0`).
// `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` silently dropped the loser in both cases. Instead a
// window function numbers the candidates per (thread, id) in array order and
// suffixes every duplicate after the first with its index — deterministic, so a
// re-run produces the same ids, and lossless, so nobody's words disappear.
