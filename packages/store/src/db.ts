/* ENG-351 — single-writer discipline for the PGlite default.

   Under `next dev` the host's server module graph is evaluated by more than
   one OS process (Turbopack spawns transient evaluator workers) and, after an
   HMR edit, more than once within one process. Each evaluation runs
   `createVendo` → `createStore` → PGlite on the SAME data dir. PGlite has no
   cross-process locking, and even a second instance's STARTUP (WAL recovery,
   pg_control writes) tears the live writer's state — the dir later reopens
   with a raw `Aborted()` and the last turns are gone (ENG-351's field trace).

   Two layers, both keyed by the resolved data dir:
   - In-process: a globalThis registry shares ONE live driver across every
     handle (and every HMR copy of this module), refcounted so closing one
     handle never tears the driver out from under another.
   - Cross-process: a `<dataDir>/.vendo-writer.lock` pidfile taken BEFORE
     PGlite.create. A second process WAITS (it never touches postgres files)
     and takes over only once the holder is provably gone — recorded pid dead,
     or the holder's mtime refresh stopped long ago (pid-reuse fallback). Lock
     release rides close(); a SIGKILLed holder self-heals via the dead-pid
     check, which is also what makes the ENG-350 postmaster.pid heal safe:
     only the lock holder ever reaches it. */

/** A PGlite boot re-reads its ~6MB wasm FS bundle from node_modules every time,
    and pnpm links that file to its shared store — so an external rewrite of the
    store's copy is visible here as a transiently truncated read, which pglite
    surfaces as `Invalid FS bundle size` (seen on CI 2026-08-16, healed by the
    next read). One delayed retry is the fix; a second identical failure means
    the installed package really is truncated.

    `PGlite failed to initialize properly` joins it: the wasm engine intermittently
    loses a boot with no lock file and no short read to blame, which on a
    `memory://` store left zero recovery path (CI killed one random test out of
    ~300 in `packages/agents` on two unrelated branches). Both are signatures of a
    boot that never started, so a second attempt is free of side effects — unlike
    `Aborted()`, which means a half-opened data dir and belongs to the stale-lock
    heal below, not here.

    Two more faces of the same half-written install (CI 2026-08-19, three runs
    each): a `.so` inside the bundle that dlopen cannot read
    (`could not load library "/pglite/lib/postgresql/plpgsql.so"`), and an initdb
    input file left behind from another version
    (`postgres.bki` … `does not belong to PostgreSQL 18.3`). Both are the bundle
    reading back wrong rather than a data dir half-opened, so they belong here
