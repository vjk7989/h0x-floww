 * Build contract §3.2 — just-bash's `IFileSystem` over the store.

 *     synchronous in just-bash, so the paths must be known without I/O), kept
 *     current on every write;
 *   - **content read through the store**, never cached — except for paths this
 *     turn has written, which stage in memory until `commit()`.
 *
 * Staging is what keeps the store write law at O(files changed): a `sed -i`
 * loop writing one file forty times is one row, one revision, one history
 * entry.
 *
 * The namespace is exactly the mounts the host asserted: `/user`, plus one
 * `/orgs/<org>` per asserted membership. A write anywhere else is refused
 * (`EACCES`) rather than accepted into memory and dropped at commit — bash's
 * own scratch belongs in the `scratch` directory each mount reserves for it.
 *
 * `/host/**` is a read-only overlay the caller supplies per turn, not store
 * rows: skills and host knowledge are code-defined (`Skill.body`,
 * contract §5), so projecting them per turn is always current, while a copy in
 * the store could go stale against the deployed code.
