// ============================================================================
// CHARACTERIZATION TEST — NOT a proof of authorization safety.
//
// store.records("vendo_grants").put(...) writes a PermissionGrant VERBATIM. The
// reserved-collection writer validates the grant's SHAPE, then trusts its caller
// completely: whoever holds a StoreAdapter handle can mint any grant they like.
//
// This is SAFE ONLY because of a STRUCTURAL invariant enforced ONE LAYER UP (in
// @vendoai/apps): app / sandbox code NEVER receives a StoreAdapter handle. App
// code reaches the host solely through the guard-bound tool proxy, which is the
// component that actually decides authorization. The store is a trusted backend
// behind that boundary — it is not, and is not meant to be, an authorization
// gate. This test documents that trust boundary as an intentional invariant so a
// future refactor that leaks a store handle into a sandbox trips a red flag here.
// ============================================================================
