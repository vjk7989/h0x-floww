// on a data dir a live writer already holds (Turbopack evaluates the host's
// server graph in transient workers too). PGlite has no cross-process lock, so
// before the fix the second instance's startup writes tore the writer's WAL —
// the dir reopened with `Aborted()` and the last turns were gone. With the
// store's single-writer lock the second opener WAITS, and only proceeds once
// the holder is dead — at which point every awaited write must still be there.
