/**
 * `ask_user` (design §4) is questions-as-a-tool: one door, any seat. Recording
 * an answer is a WRITE into somebody's thread, so it rides the same
 * subject-scoped gate as every other thread write.
 *
 * These are the security tests for that extension. The threat is specific: an
 * answer arrives from a client, carrying a thread id and an answer body. If the
 * gate trusted either, one person could write into another person's
 * conversation — putting words in their transcript, and (because the transcript
 * is what the next turn reads) steering their agent.
