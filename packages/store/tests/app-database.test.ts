/**
 * The app-database SEAM, end to end, with nothing stubbed on either side.
 *
 * Producer: `@vendoai/apps`' real door — the guard, the physical names, the
 * per-owner schema replay. Consumer: this package's real Postgres adapter over
 * a real Postgres engine. A harness that mocked either half would prove only
 * that it agrees with itself, which is the exact failure this repo has shipped
 * four times.
 *
 * The engine here is PGlite — a real Postgres compiled to wasm, so schemas,
 * `search_path` and `pg_namespace` all behave — and it needs no server, so this
 * suite CANNOT skip itself. A run against a real Postgres 16 server is the rig
 * in the storage lane's report; this is the one that gates every commit.
 *
 * The adversarial half is the point: Grace tries to read, write, delete and
 * enumerate Ada's rows, by every address the door might have left open.
