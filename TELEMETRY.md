# Vendo Telemetry

Vendo collects anonymous, opt-out telemetry from build and development tooling so the project can understand setup success, feature use, and reliability. Product telemetry is build/dev-side only and never fires from a deployed production app.

## What Is Collected

Every event uses a random anonymous id plus the event properties listed here. The allowlist below mirrors `packages/vendo-telemetry/src/events.ts`; keys outside these sets are dropped before sending.

Every event carries the base properties `vendoVersion`, `osPlatform`, `nodeVersion`, `projectIdHash`, and `packageManager` (written *base* below). `packageManager` is a closed enum — `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun` — read from the package manager's own user-agent env var, and omitted when unknown. `projectIdHash` is described under Anonymous Identity.

| Event | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| `init_started` | *base*, `framework` |
| `init_completed` | *base*, `framework`, `provider`, `llmSkipped`, `keyPrompt`, `command`, `toolCount`, `durationMs`, `typescript`, `router`, `engine`, `apiDetectMethod`, `routeCount`, `themeExtracted`, `frameworkVersion`, `reactVersion`, `zodVersion`, `typescriptVersion` |
| `init_failed` | *base*, `framework`, `failedStep`, `errorClass` |
| `doctor_run` | *base*, `failures`, `warnings`, `wired` |
| `command_run` | *base*, `command`, `ok`, `failedStep`, `errorClass`, `durationMs` |
| `star_prompt` | *base*, `outcome` |
| `agent_run` | *base* |
| `error_class` | *base*, `errorClass` |

`init_completed` fields are all small integers, bools, or short enums: `command` is `init` only; `typescript` and `themeExtracted` are bools; `router` is the closed enum `app` | `pages` | `none`; `engine` (which AI-polish engine ran) is `claude` | `codex` | `npx-engine` | `none`; `apiDetectMethod` is `route-scan` | `zod` | `none`; `routeCount` is the count of route-bound tools. `frameworkVersion`/`reactVersion`/`zodVersion`/`typescriptVersion` are bare dependency version strings from the host `package.json` with range prefixes stripped (`^15.3.1` → `15.3.1`) — non-identifying, omitted when the dependency is absent.

`init_failed` and `command_run` carry `failedStep` (a short step enum) and `errorClass` (the error's constructor name, e.g. `TypeError`) — never message text. `command_run` fires once per tracked CLI command run; its `command` is the closed enum `login` | `extract` | `theme` | `sync` | `cloud-init` | `mcp` | `knowledge` — each a standalone `vendo <command>` except `cloud-init`, which fires from the cloud step inside `vendo init` (the standalone run of the same claim ceremony is `login`) — with `ok` a bool and `durationMs` an integer. Retired values (`playground`, `refine`, `try`, `eject`, and the retired `extract_completed` event) survive only in historical rows. `doctor_run` carries the health-check's hard-`failures` count, `warnings` count, and a `wired` bool. `star_prompt` reports interactive init's consented star ask: `outcome` is the closed enum `starred` | `star-failed` | `declined`, and the event never fires on non-interactive runs. No event carries component names, ids, labels, file paths, keys, or any other content — counts and enums only.

Example payload:

  }
}
```

## What Is Never Collected

Vendo telemetry never collects source code, file paths, prompts, generated UI, tool inputs or outputs, API keys, host app names, environment values, request bodies, raw error messages, or stack traces. (Cloud-configured installs send a scrubbed `errorDetail` — see When Vendo Cloud Is Configured.) The `packageManager` name is classified into a closed enum from the npm user-agent env var; no raw env values are sent.

## Anonymous Identity

Vendo creates a random UUID and stores it in `~/.vendo/telemetry.json` with two preferences: `optedOut` and `noticeShown`. The id is not derived from a machine, account, project, host app, or environment value. Deleting the file rotates the id.

`projectIdHash` identifies a project opaquely so events from the same repo can be grouped. It is a one-way SHA-256 of the git origin URL (normalized so ssh and https spellings match), or of the `package.json` name when there is no remote, and omitted when neither exists. A fixed public salt (`vendo-telemetry-project-v1`) is prepended before hashing; the raw URL or name is never sent and cannot be recovered from the hash. Changing the remote rotates the hash.

## When Vendo Cloud Is Configured

Setting a well-formed `VENDO_API_KEY` (`vnd_` plus 40 hex characters) switches telemetry into the cloud lane. Nothing else activates it, and every opt-out below still applies — an opted-out user with a cloud key sends nothing.

In the cloud lane every event additionally carries `cloud: true` and `cloudKeyHash`, the SHA-256 of the API key. The Vendo console stores key hashes, so cloud events can be joined to the owning account; PostHog never receives the key itself.

Cloud-lane events may also carry these extra properties (the `CLOUD_PROP_KEYS` set in `packages/vendo-telemetry/src/events.ts`), allowed on every event: `projectName`, `repoHost`, `errorDetail`, and the per-stage init timings `detectMs`, `engineMs`, `themeMs`, `wiringMs`. Without a valid key these keys are stripped before sending, even if the tooling passes them.

`errorDetail` is the only free-text property Vendo ever sends. It is scrubbed first: file paths, email addresses, and secret-shaped strings (API keys, bearer tokens, long hex or base64 runs) are replaced with fixed tokens like `[path]` and `[secret]`, then the result is capped at 200 characters. The telemetry client re-scrubs every `errorDetail` as defense-in-depth even when the caller already did.

## Opt Out

Any one of these disables product telemetry:

- `VENDO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
- set `"optedOut": true` in `~/.vendo/telemetry.json`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`
- CI environments, detected from `CI`
- Production runtime, when `NODE_ENV=production`

Set `"optedOut": false` in `~/.vendo/telemetry.json` to clear the local opt-out flag. Scarf also honors `DO_NOT_TRACK`.

## Internal Runs (VENDO_INTERNAL)

`VENDO_INTERNAL=1` (or `true`) tags every event with `internal: true` instead of disabling telemetry. It exists for Vendo's own harnesses — certification campaigns, install evals, sandbox benches — that intentionally exercise the real telemetry path end-to-end: the events still flow (so the pipeline stays verifiable) but analytics excludes them from product metrics by filtering on the `internal` property. The marker is producer-set like the cloud markers, so event callers cannot spoof or clear it. It is not a consent mechanism and does not weaken any opt-out above: `CI`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, and `VENDO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` still send nothing regardless of `VENDO_INTERNAL`.

## Where Data Goes

Events are sent to PostHog US Cloud using a write-only project key. Set `VENDO_POSTHOG_HOST` to send them to your own PostHog instead (`VENDO_POSTHOG_KEY` sets the project key).

There are two destinations, chosen by event, and nothing is ever sent to both:

| Destination | Events | Path | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product analytics | `init_started`, `init_completed`, `init_failed`, `star_prompt`, `error_class` | `/capture/` | Kept |
| Logs | `doctor_run`, `command_run`, `agent_run` | `/i/v1/logs` | 30 days, enforced |

`doctor_run`, `command_run`, and `agent_run` are operational records — "this ran, here is how it went" — not funnel steps, so they go to PostHog's Logs product, which enforces a 30-day retention window. They are sent as OTLP/JSON with `service.name` `vendo-sdk`; the event name rides as both the log record's `eventName` and an `event` attribute, the anonymous id as a `distinct_id` attribute, and each allowlisted property as an attribute of the same name. The allowlist, the scrubbing, and every opt-out below apply identically on both paths — moving an event changes only where it is stored and for how long.

Network calls are fire-and-forget, use a short timeout, and failures are swallowed so telemetry cannot break builds or dev servers. The capture socket is unref'd the moment it exists, so a telemetry POST can never keep the CLI running after a command finishes — on a captive-portal network that accepts the connection and never answers, `vendo init` still exits as soon as it prints its summary.

Published package download attribution is wired through Scarf for npm installs. Scarf registration is an owner-operated package setup step.
