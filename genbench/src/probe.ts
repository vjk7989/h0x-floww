 * "press Open, and a status picker and a Save appear in the page" is the same shape
 * as a confirmation, and the probe walked into `[role=dialog]` and not into this —
 * so the controls that do the work went unpressed and the screens that had the
 * second step RIGHT were the ones that failed `actionProven`.
 *
 * In ORDER, on ONE page, which is where this parts company with the dialog walk and
 * has to: a dialog's controls are alternative ANSWERS to one question — press
 * "Confirm" and pressing "Cancel" afterwards means nothing — while a reveal's are
 * usually one FORM, and the Save at the end of it is locked until the picker before
 * it is answered. Isolating each path would have left every such Save disabled and
 * skipped, which is the failure this exists to fix. Document order is the order a
 * person meets them, it is one pass, and nothing here hunts for a combination.
 *
 * A control an earlier press in the sequence took off the screen is skipped rather
 * than pressed into thin air: a five-second click that lands on nothing would go on
 * the trace as a control that did nothing, which invents exactly the dead control
 * this walk exists to stop inventing.
 *
 * And the last step of the form is often a CONFIRMATION, so a press in here that
 * opens a dialog is walked exactly as one at the top level is (2026-08-18). The
 * probe stopped at the reveal's edge, and `project-tracker/capacity-rebalance`
 * failed `actionProven` with the whole flow right and the write one press further
 * in: "Hand off" revealed a picker and a Confirm, Confirm opened a Modal, and the
 * Modal's own button is what calls `assign_issue`. Reveal then dialog, and there it
 * stops — `insideDialog` never walks a dialog a press inside a dialog opened, so
 * the depth is two and cannot grow.
 *
 * `reopen` is the walk back to the reveal itself, handed in by the caller for
 * `insideDialog`'s reason: only the caller knows which control opened it. Getting
 * back to the DIALOG is that walk plus the presses in here that led to it, which is
