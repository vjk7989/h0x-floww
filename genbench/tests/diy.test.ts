/**
 * The fairness assertion, for every contender.
 *
 * Every number this benchmark reports rests on one claim: each in-house
 * contender was handed EXACTLY what the product's own pipeline was handed. So
 * the bytes are compared. The design brief the vendo driver composes and the
 * descriptors its registry serves must appear verbatim in the prompt EACH
 * baseline sends — and the responses that registry returns must appear in NONE
 * of them, because handing a baseline the rows is handing it the answer to a
 * question the vendo column has to call a tool to ask. If any side ever drifts —
 * a reformatted brief, a hand-rolled schema dump, a canned response creeping
 * back into a prompt — this test fails and the comparison is void.
 *
 * The two baselines share one serializer (`worldBlock`) precisely so they
 * cannot drift apart, but a shared helper is not the assertion: the prompt
 * under test is the one each driver actually put on the wire, read off the
 * model `diy` streamed through and off the session `claude-code` opened. Only
 * the model and the SDK are doubles.
