/**
 * The suites that launch a real Chromium through `openBrowser`.
 *
 * CI installs no Playwright browsers — `release.yml` is the only workflow that
 * runs `playwright install`, and only for `@vendoai/ui` — and `ci.yml` says why:
 * headless CI mis-resolves `:focus-visible` and `light-dark()`, so browser runs
 * stay a LOCAL gate on purpose. These would therefore not fail on their findings
 * there, they would fail on a missing executable.
 *
 * So they are dropped where the browser is missing and nowhere else. `CI` is the
 * flag because CI is the environment that lacks the browsers, and because it is
 * already declared in turbo.json's `test`/`test:coverage` env list, so the cache
 * key knows which of the two sets a replayed run actually covered. Locally,
 * unset, every suite runs exactly as it did before.
 *
 * `diy.test.ts` is here for ONE test (`the page answers the way the prompt
 * promised`); its fifteen model-boundary tests ride along. `regrade.test.ts` is
 * here for one too — recovering a settled DOM out of a saved page, which is the
 * one path in a re-score that paints anything. Splitting either file would let
 * the rest of it run in CI.
