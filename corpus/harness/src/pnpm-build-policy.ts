/** pnpm ≥10 errors (ERR_PNPM_CONFIG_CONFLICT_BUILT_DEPENDENCIES) on
 * dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds when the workspace already declares a curated
 * build allowlist — detect that curation, whether it lives in
 * pnpm-workspace.yaml (onlyBuiltDependencies/neverBuiltDependencies, or the
 * newer allowBuilds map umami uses) or in the package.json `pnpm` field
 * (ENG-334). Shared by the bootstrap and post-injection install-command
 * paths so both respect a repo's own build policy instead of forcing
 * dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds on top of it.
 *
 * The package.json `pnpm` field only counts under a packageManager pin ≤10:
 * pnpm 11 silently ignores the field, so for a repo that will run pnpm ≥11 —
 * a pin ≥11, or no pin at all (the harness environment provides pnpm 11,
 * same convention as inject.ts's writeStandalonePnpmWorkspaceOverrides) — a
 * legacy field is neither applied by pnpm nor in conflict with the blanket
 * flag, and dropping dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds for it would leave the repo
 * on pnpm 11's default build policy with required dependency builds skipped
 * (corpus-triage review finding: cubic P1). */
