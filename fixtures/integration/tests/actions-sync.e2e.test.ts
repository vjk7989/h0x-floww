/** J8 — ACTIONS OPENAPI SYNC → callable over the composed wire.
 *
 * `vendoSync` is the build-time extractor (packages/actions/src/sync): it reads a
 * host project's OpenAPI spec (+ route scan), and writes `.vendo/tools.json` — the
 * SAME contract file `createVendo` loads at boot (`createActions({ dir: "." })`).
 * This journey proves the whole loop end to end against the REAL fixture host:
 *
 *   1. run `vendoSync` against the fixture host-app's real `openapi.json`,
 *   2. it produces a schema-valid `.vendo/tools.json` carrying the extracted host
 *      tools (host_listInvoices=read, host_createInvoice=write, …),
 *   3. author the governance `.vendo/policy.json` (init scaffolds this; sync owns
 *      only tools.json) so the read tool runs without an approval, and
 *   4. boot the REAL composed umbrella with that freshly-synced `.vendo/` as its
 *      cwd and drive a chat turn that calls one synced tool over the PUBLIC wire —
 *      the composed guard binds it, actions executes its route binding as a real
 *      HTTP call to the fixture host, and the invoices come back on the stream.
 *
 * Nothing here is hand-wired: the tool the wire calls exists ONLY because sync
 * extracted it from the spec moments earlier.
