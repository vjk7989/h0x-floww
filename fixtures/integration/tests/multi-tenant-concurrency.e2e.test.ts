/** J10 — MULTI-TENANT CONCURRENCY: isolation holds under a real race.
 *
 * N distinct signed-in tenants drive chat + apps + automations THROUGH THE WIRE
 * concurrently (Promise.all — genuinely interleaved on one composed umbrella and
 * one shared store), then the suite asserts the one-security-rule ownership
 * boundary survived the race:
 *
 *   - each tenant's thread / app / automation-run is visible ONLY to that tenant,
 *   - no tenant can open another tenant's app or run over the wire,
 *   - the store's per-subject row counts are exactly right (no cross-write), and
 *   - each tenant's away automation produced exactly ITS invoice, once.
 *
 * This also pins the automations tick/emit path under concurrency (the surface
 * the perf lane is changing): N concurrent `vendo.emit`s must each fan out to
 * exactly the emitting principal's enabled app.
 *
 * Model note: the shared scripted model is a single FIFO, so a concurrent turn
 * that pulled a multi-part (tool→generate→text) sequence could interleave across
 * requests. The chat leg therefore uses a SINGLE identical text turn per tenant
 * (one pull each, order-independent); apps + automations enter through the
 * model-free wire paths (/apps/import, enable/approve, vendo.emit).
