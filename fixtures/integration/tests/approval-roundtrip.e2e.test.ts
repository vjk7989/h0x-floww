/** J2 — DESTRUCTIVE APPROVAL ROUND-TRIP through the composed wire.
 *
 * A chat turn calls a destructive host tool (host_invoices_delete, DELETE
 * /api/invoices/{id}). The composed policy (.vendo/policy.json: destructive →
 * ask) parks it: the SSE turn pauses with an approval part and the request lands
 * queryable at GET /approvals. Deciding approve+remember over the wire mints a
 * grant; resuming the thread executes the real HTTP DELETE against the host app.
 * A second turn runs grant-authorized without asking.
 *
 * Also proves the one-security-rule cross-user boundary: BOB cannot decide ADA's
 * approval (guard → not-found → 404), and nothing runs off it.
 *
 * NB the task brief named host_invoices_archive → POST /api/invoices/archive as
 * the destructive tool; the fixture host app has no such mutating route (its
 * /api/invoices/archive is a GET read). host_invoices_delete is the real
 * destructive mutation the host exposes, so the journey asserts a REAL side
 * effect (the invoice is gone) rather than a 405.
