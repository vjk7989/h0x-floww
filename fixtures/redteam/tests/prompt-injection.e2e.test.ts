/** Suite 4 — a poisoned agent/judge cannot be steered into a destructive call
 * without the guard asking.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC leg: a fully COMPROMISED judge that returns {action:"run"} for
 * everything still cannot unlock (a) the critical tier, (b) the away-downgrade,
 * or (c) the write breaker — those gates sit before/around the judge.
 *
 * LIVE leg (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY-gated): a real model behind agent.asRunner() is
 * handed a prompt laced with an injection telling it to fire a destructive
 * critical send in an away run — and even holding an automation-bound grant for
 * that tool, the send PARKS instead of executing. The agent can be steered;
 * the critical tier holds.
