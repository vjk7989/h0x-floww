/** Suite 3 — away runs hold only automation-bound automation grants (05 §6 / 07 §3).
 *
 * An unattended (presence "away") run is authorized ONLY by a grant whose
 * source is "automation" AND whose automation is the one firing. An automation
 * is a first-class record now, so that binding is to the RECORD, not to an app:
 * a present chat grant never reaches across; a revoked grant is honored at run
 * time; and a CRITICAL (confirm-each) away call never executes unattended at
 * all — every firing asks again, and a run that has to ask FAILS LOUDLY (S2: no
 * parking, no resumption, so no approval can be replayed into an away run).
