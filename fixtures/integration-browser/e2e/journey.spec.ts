/** J7 — UI HOOKS IN A REAL BROWSER, end to end through the composed umbrella.
 *
 * The shipped `VendoProvider` + `<VendoThread />` chrome and a `useApps` probe drive
 * the REAL `createVendo` wire (proxied same-origin) against the booted fixture
 * host app. One deterministic journey, no live keys:
 *
 *   1. send a chat message → the scripted assistant text streams and renders;
 *   2. send a destructive-tool turn → the composed destructive-ask policy parks
 *      it → the approval surfaces in-thread → click Approve → the resume executes
 *      the REAL host DELETE (asserted by polling the host API) and the thread
 *      shows completion;
 *   3. the `useApps` surface lists the app a scripted generation turn produced.
 *
 * This is the first time the shipped hooks/chrome talk to the actual composed
 * wire (every other browser suite runs against a hand-built wire fixture) — a
 * hooks-vs-wire mismatch would surface right here.
