/** The automations harness: composes REAL blocks the way the umbrella does —

 * principal owns, created through the ONE create operation every authoring door
 * calls, and read back through the engine's own list/get. Suites get that create
 * op, the runner map, fixture reset/login helpers, the seeded host tool surface,
 * an ActAs that logs into the fixture, and raw SQL access (store.raw()) for the
 * vendo_automations / vendo_runs / vendo_grants asserts.
