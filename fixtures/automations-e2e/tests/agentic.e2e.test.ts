/**
 * The caged dispatcher: at 2am the run sees it, and only granted actions execute.
 *
 * `use_service_tool` is a whole third-party catalog behind one tool name, so its
 * descriptor is `ungraded` — and §12's projection withholds every `ungraded`
 * descriptor from an unattended run exactly as it withholds destructive ones
 * (`withheldFromUnattended`, core grant-sets.ts). Applied to the dispatcher with
 * no exception, that did not cage a goal automation's connector access, it
 * REMOVED it: no unattended run could reach a connector at all, however
 * explicitly a person had allowed one particular action.
 *
 * So the projection has exactly one exemption, and these pin its edges: the
 * dispatcher is on an unattended listing IFF the firing RECORD holds at least one
 * live per-slug service grant (`isGrantedDispatcher`, core grant-sets.ts; the
 * slugs are read at fire time by the engine). One tool name, not a risk level —
 * every other `ungraded` tool stays withheld — and `destructive` has no exemption
 * at all.
 *
 * How a record comes to hold such a grant is the only thing that moved: a goal
 * task declares no tools, so arming captures none, and the grant is earned the
 * way people really earn one — the run reaches for the slug, the guard parks the
 * card away, the owner allows it, and the NEXT firing is read against it. That is
 * "Grant & re-run", through both real doors.
 *
 * THE PINNED LAWS, restated for a goal run, and untouched by any of that because
 * they are CALL-time: an unattended run can never call an ungranted slug, and a
 * destructive-graded slug never executes away — granted or not. Being shown the
 * door is not being through it.
