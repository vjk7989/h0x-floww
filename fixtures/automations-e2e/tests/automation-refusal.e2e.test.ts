/**
 * The refusal law at AUTHORING time (§12): an ask whose unattended fulfillment
 * needs an irreversible effect is refused here, in the planner, with a sentence
 * that names why and what IS possible instead.
 *
 * Why it has to be the planner and not just the arm: the generation pipeline
 * plans with the CREATING person's context (`presence: "present"`), so
 * `projectableForRun` hands it the destructive tools too — a plan naming one
 * validates, lands, and then dies at arm time as "unknown tool in automation",
 * because the away run is the venue where the law withholds it. The person is
 * told nothing useful. Refusing at authoring time is the only place the answer
 * can still be a sentence about their request.
 *
 * `host_invoices_send` is the case that matters, and it is graded `destructive`
 * because THE DECLARED LABEL IS THE TRUTH. This test was first written against a
 * `write`-declared send tool that core's `mechanicalRisk` name vote overruled;
 * that vote was deleted repo-wide with two-vote grading (#791), and
 * `packages/actions/tests/sync/protocol-facts.test.ts` now forbids concluding
 * anything from a tool's name. So a mislabelled tool is a grading problem
 * (`vendo sync`, `.vendo/overrides.json`), not the planner's — and what the
 * planner owes is exactly what is asserted below: a labelled-irreversible tool is
 * never offered, and an ask that needs one comes back as a sentence.
