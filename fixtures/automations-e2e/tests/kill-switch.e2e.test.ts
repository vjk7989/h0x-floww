/** 07 §1 runs.stop — the kill switch. A run held mid-flight (inside a
 * blocking in-process step tool) is cancelled best-effort: it is marked
 * "stopped" with finishedAt set, steps after the stop never execute, stop is
 * owner-scoped, and a terminal run cannot be stopped again.
 * (The hold vehicle was an fn: step against a v1 in-process machine; that
 * path died with execution-v2 Wave 1.5, so the hold now rides a fixture-local
 * wrapped tool — the run mechanics under test are unchanged.)
