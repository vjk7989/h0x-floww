/**
 * The consent card an authored goal automation actually shows its owner.
 *
 * The seam, end to end and unmocked on both sides: the REAL planner
 * (`planAutomation`, the one the generation server lane calls) authors the
 * automation, the REAL create operation stores it, and the REAL arm-time capture
 * (`automations.enable`) reads it back. Each side stubbed the other before, which
 * is how "review the invoices and write a note" shipped an enable card asking for
 * 31 standing permissions — including Send money — behind one "Allow all 31 &
 * enable" button.
 *
 * ONE of that finding's two guarantees survives the centralization. `AutomationTask`
 * has no place for the tool set an authored plan declares, so the card can no
 * longer be the plan's own width: EVERY goal record gets the fallback surface and
 * the narrowing is the person's, card by card. What still holds — and what this
 * pins — is that the fallback never asks for a standing away grant a firing could
 * not run on. Asking to allow a thing that can never happen is a false choice, not
 * consent, and there are two ways to be that: a tool THE LAW refuses away
 * (`destructive`/`ungraded`), and a confirm-each tool, which needs a person EVERY
 * time and which no grant may ever suppress. `host_invoices_send` is the first
 * kind; `host_invoices_send_critical` is the second.
